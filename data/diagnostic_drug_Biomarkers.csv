Gleevec exposure was systematically increased in successive cohorts by earlier introduction and more prolonged duration. The safety of Gleevec given in combination with intensive chemotherapy was evaluated by comparing the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, neutropenia (less than 750/mcL) and thrombocytopenia (less than 75,000/mcL) in the 92 patients with Ph+ ALL compared to 65 patients with Ph- ALL enrolled on the trial who did not receive Gleevec. The safety was also evaluated comparing the incidence of adverse events in cycles of therapy administered with or without Gleevec. The protocol included up to 18 cycles of therapy. Patients were exposed to a cumulative total of 1425 cycles of therapy, 778 with Gleevec and 647 without Gleevec.
