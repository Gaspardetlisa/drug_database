From the cases of NSCLC, approximately 75% of the patients present a late diagnosis with metastatic and advanced disease which produces a survival rate of 5%.

196,DB12267,Alunbrig#Brigatinib,Brigatinib,"The anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (ALK+ NSCLC), represents only 3-5% of the NSCLC cancer cases, but the ALK mutation, overexpression and presence in several oncogenic fusion proteins in solid and hematologic tumors have pointed out the importance as well as its potential as a cancer therapy target.1 The ALK-related cases of NSCLC are associated with the presence of the fusion gene EML4-ALK which fused the ALK protein with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like-4 whose original function is the correct formation of microtubules.2 The presence of the aberrant fusion protein results in abnormal signaling that provokes increased cell growth, proliferation and survival.4 Crizotinib is indicated for the treatment of such cases but the presence of ALK kinase domain mutations confer resistance to the treatment. Thus, brigatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with ALK+ NSCLC with intolerance to Crizotinib.3
