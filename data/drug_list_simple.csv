The safety of PIQRAY was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (SOLAR-1) in 571 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer enrolled into two cohorts, with or without a PIK3CA mutation [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Patients received either PIQRAY 300 mg plus fulvestrant (n = 284) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 287). Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered intramuscularly on Cycle 1, Day 1 and 15, and then at Day 1 of each 28-day cycle during treatment phase. Two patients (0.7%) died while on treatment with PIQRAY plus fulvestrant due to causes other than the underlying malignancy. Causes of death included one cardio-respiratory arrest and one second primary malignancy. Neither was suspected to be related to study treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant. Serious adverse reactions in > 2% of patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant included hyperglycemia (10%), rash (3.5%), diarrhea (2.8%), acute kidney injury (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.1%), and anemia (2.1%). Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was reported in 4.2% of patients (12/284) in the PIQRAY plus fulvestrant arm compared to 1.4% of patients (4/287) in the placebo arm. All patients experiencing ONJ had prior or concomitant bisphosphonates or RANK-ligand inhibitor administration. Among patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant, 4.6% permanently discontinued both PIQRAY and fulvestrant and 21% permanently discontinued PIQRAY alone, due to ARs. The most frequent ARs leading to treatment discontinuation of PIQRAY in > 2% patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant were hyperglycemia (6%), rash (4.2%), diarrhea (2.8%), and fatigue (2.5%). Dose reductions due to ARs occurred in 55% of patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant. The most frequent ARs leading to dose reduction in > 2% patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant were hyperglycemia (29%), rash (9%), diarrhea (6%), stomatitis (3.5%), and mucosal inflammation (2.1%). The most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities (all grades, incidence ≥ 20%) were glucose increased, creatinine increased, diarrhea, rash, lymphocyte count decreased, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased, nausea, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, fatigue, hemoglobin decreased, lipase increased, decreased appetite, stomatitis, vomiting, weight decreased, calcium decreased, glucose decreased, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolonged, and alopecia.

Safety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received TARCEVA as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with TARCEVA are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations The most frequent (≥ 30%) adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were rash and diarrhea. Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of TARCEVA-treated patients, and 14.3% of TARCEVA-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In TARCEVA-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%). Common adverse reactions in Study 1, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received TARCEVA or chemotherapy and an increase in ≥ 5% in the TARCEVA-treated group, are graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) Grade in Table 1 .

TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Pancreatic Cancer - TARCEVA Administered Concurrently with Gemcitabine This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TARCEVA (150 mg or 100 mg daily) or placebo plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m 2 by intravenous infusion) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (Study 5). The safety population comprised 282 patients in the erlotinib group (259 in the 100 mg cohort and 23 in the 150 mg cohort) and 280 patients in the placebo group (256 in the 100 mg cohort and 24 in the 150 mg cohort). Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer (Study 5) were graded according to NCI-CTC v2.0 in Table 4 . The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving TARCEVA plus gemcitabine. Severe adverse reactions (≥ Grade 3 NCI-CTC) in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group with incidences < 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

Safety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received TARCEVA as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with TARCEVA are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations The most frequent   adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were rash and diarrhea. Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of TARCEVA-treated patients, and 14.3% of TARCEVA-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In TARCEVA-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%). Common adverse reactions in Study 1, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received TARCEVA or chemotherapy and an increase  TARCEVA-treated group, are graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) Grade in Table 1.

Pancreatic Cancer -TARCEVA Administered Concurrently with Gemcitabine This was a randomized, doubleŒblind, placebo-controlled study of TARCEVA (150 mg or 100 mg daily) or placebo plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (Study 5). The safety population comprised 282 patients in the erlotinib group (259 in the 100 mg cohort and 23 in the 150 mg cohort) and 280 patients in the placebo group (256 in the 100 mg cohort and 24 in the 150 mg cohort). Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer (Study 5) were graded according to NCI-CTC v2.0 in Table 4. The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving TARCEVA plus gemcitabine.    -CTC) in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group with incidences < 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

Unless noted, data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below reflects exposure to VITRAKVI in 279 patients, including 54% patients exposed for greater than 6 months and 30% patients exposed for greater than 1 year. VITRAKVI was studied in one adult dose-finding trial [LOXO-TRK-14001 (n = 75)], one pediatric dose-finding trial [SCOUT (n = 88)], and one single arm trial [NAVIGATE (n = 116)]. All patients had an unresectable or metastatic solid tumor and no satisfactory alternative treatment options or disease progression following treatment. Across these 279 patients, the median age was 46 years (range: 0.1 days to 84 years); 33% were younger than 18 years; 48% were male; and 74% were White, 9% were Hispanic/Latino, 7% in order of decreasing frequency were soft tissue sarcoma (17%), thyroid (13%), infantile fibrosarcoma (12%), primary central nervous system (CNS) (11%), salivary gland (9%), lung (9%), colon (6%), breast (4%), or melanoma (3%). NTRK gene fusions were confirmed or inferred in 75% of VITRAKVI-treated patients. Most adults (86%) received VITRAKVI 100 mg orally twice daily and 85% of pediatrics (< 18 years) received VITRAKVI 100 mg/m2 twice daily up to a maximum dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dose ranged from 50 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily in adults and 9.6 mg/m2 twice daily to 120 mg/m2 twice daily in pediatrics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. decreasing frequency were increased AST, increased ALT, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, hypoalbuminemia, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, cough, leukopenia, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, lymphopenia, and abdominal pain.

Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) The adverse reactions described in Table 3 were identified in 804 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in CLEOPATRA. Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The median duration of study treatment was 18.1 months for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 11.8 months for patients in the placebo-treated group. No dose adjustment was permitted for PERJETA or trastuzumab. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of all study therapy were 6% in the PERJETA-treated group and 5% for patients in the placebo-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (>1%) that led to discontinuation of all study therapy was left ventricular dysfunction (1% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 2% for patients in the placebo-treated group). The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of docetaxel alone were edema, fatigue, edema peripheral, neuropathy peripheral, neutropenia, nail disorder and pleural effusion. Table 3 reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group. The safety profile of PERJETA remained unchanged with an additional 2.75 years of follow-up (median total follow-up of 50 months) in CLEOPATRA. The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common NCI - CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 – 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, asthenia, and fatigue. An increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for Asian patients in both treatment arms compared with patients of other races and from other geographic regions. Among Asian patients, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the pertuzumab-treated group (26%) compared with the placebo-treated group (12%).

All adverse reactions in the PERJETA and trastuzumab treatment group occurred in < 10% of patients with the exception of diarrhea (19%), upper respiratory tract infection (13%), rash (12%), headache (11%), and fatigue (11%). Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (NeoSphere) In NeoSphere, the most common adverse reactions seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel administered for 4 cycles were similar to those seen in the PERJETA-treated group in CLEOPATRA. The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea. The most common NCI – CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 – 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and diarrhea. In this group, one patient permanently discontinued neoadjuvant treatment due to an adverse event.

When PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 – 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, neutrophil count decreased, anemia, white blood cell count decreased, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, and stomatitis. The incidence of diarrhea, all Grades, was higher when chemotherapy was administered with targeted therapy (61% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 34% in the placebo-treated group), and was higher when administered with non-anthracycline based therapy (85% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 62% in the placebo-treated group) than with anthracycline based therapy (67% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 41% in the placebo-treated group). The incidence of diarrhea during the period that targeted therapy was administered without chemotherapy was 18% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 9% in the placebo-treated group. The median duration of all Grades diarrhea was 8 days for the PERJETA-treated group vs. 6 days for the placebo-treated group. The median duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 20 days for the PERJETA-treated group vs. 8 days for the placebo-treated group. More patients required hospitalization for diarrhea as a serious adverse event in the PERJETA-treated group (2.4%) than in the placebo-treated group (0.7%).

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to pertuzumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Patients in CLEOPATRA were tested at multiple time-points for antibodies to PERJETA. 3% (13/389) of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 7% (25/372) of patients in the placebo-treated group tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies. Of these 38 patients, none experienced anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions that were clearly related to the anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The presence of pertuzumab in patient serum at the levels expected at the time of ADA sampling can interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-pertuzumab antibodies. In addition, the assay may be detecting antibodies to trastuzumab. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-pertuzumab antibody development. In the neoadjuvant period of BERENICE, 0.3% (1/383) of patients treated with PERJETA tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies. This patient did not experience any anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of PERJETA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with PERJETA. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g., bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated.']","PERJETA is a HER2/neu receptor antagonist indicated for: Use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) The adverse reactions described in Table 3 were identified in 804 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in CLEOPATRA.  Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The median duration of study treatment was 18.1 months for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 11.8 months for patients in the placebo-treated group.  No dose adjustment was permitted for PERJETA or trastuzumab.  Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of all study therapy were 6% in the PERJETA-treated group and 5% for patients in the placebo-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (>1%) that led to discontinuation of all study therapy was left ventricular dysfunction (1% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 2% for patients in the placebo-treated group). The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of docetaxel alone were edema, fatigue, edema peripheral, neuropathy peripheral, neutropenia, nail disorder and pleural effusion. Table 3 reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group. The safety profile of PERJETA remained unchanged with an additional 2.75 years of follow-up (median total follow-up of 50 months) in CLEOPATRA. The most common adverse reactions ( 30%) seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy.  The most common NCI -CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 Œ 4 adverse reactions ( 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, asthenia, and fatigue. An increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for Asian patients in both treatment arms compared with patients of other races and from other geographic regions. Among Asian patients, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the pertuzumab-treated group (26%) compared with the placebo-treated group (12%).

The most common NCICTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 Œ 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, left ventricular dysfunction, anemia, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.  Similarly, when PERJETA was administered in combination with docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) for 6 cycles, the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.  The most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 Œ 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, fatigue, ALT increased, hypokalemia, and hypersensitivity.  Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of any component of neoadjuvant treatment occurred in 7% of patients receiving PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 8% for patients receiving PERJETA in combination with TCH.

Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study therapy were 13% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 12% for patients in the placebo-treated group. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of PERJETA or placebo was 7% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (>0.5%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study treatment were ejection fraction decreased, neuropathy peripheral, diarrhea, and cardiac failure. Table 7 reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group. When PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 Œ 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, neutrophil count decreased, anemia, white blood cell count decreased, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, and stomatitis. The incidence of diarrhea, all Grades, was higher when chemotherapy was administered with targeted therapy (61% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 34% in the placebo-treated group), and was higher when administered with non-anthracycline based therapy (85% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 62% in the placebo-treated group) than with anthracycline based therapy (67% Page 19 of 36 Reference ID: 4547429                                                                                                                                                                                                      in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 41% in the placebo-treated group). The incidence of diarrhea during the period that targeted therapy was administered without chemotherapy was 18% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 9% in the placebo-treated group. The median duration of all Grades diarrhea was 8 days for the PERJETA-treated group vs. 6 days for the placebo-treated group. PERJETA-treated group vs. 8 days for the placebo-treated group. More patients required hospitalization for diarrhea as a serious adverse event in the PERJETA-treated group (2.4%) than in the placebo-treated group (0.7%).

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to pertuzumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Patients in CLEOPATRA were tested at multiple time-points for antibodies to PERJETA. 3% (13/389) of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 7% (25/372) of patients in the placebo-treated group tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies.  Of these 38 patients, none experienced anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions that were clearly related to the anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The presence of pertuzumab in patient serum at the levels expected at the time of ADA sampling can interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-pertuzumab antibodies.  In addition, the assay may be detecting antibodies to trastuzumab.  As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-pertuzumab antibody development. In the neoadjuvant period of BERENICE, 0.3% (1/383) of patients treated with PERJETA tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies. This patient did not experience any anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of PERJETA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with PERJETA. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g., bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated. "

Acute Myeloid Leukemia The safety evaluation of RYDAPT (50 mg twice daily with food) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML is based on a randomized, double-blind, trial of RYDAPT (n = 345) or placebo (n = 335) with chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The overall median duration of exposure was 42 days (range 2 to 576 days) for patients in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm versus 34 Reference ID: 4782264                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    days (range 1 to 465 days) for patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy arm. On the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm, 35% of patients completed induction and consolidation therapy, compared to 25% of patients on the placebo plus chemotherapy arm. The most frequent (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm were febrile neutropenia, nausea, mucositis, vomiting, headache, petechiae, musculoskeletal pain, epistaxis, device-related infection, hyperglycemia, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, and upper respiratory tract infections. The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (incidence 10%) were febrile neutropenia, device-related infection and mucositis. as febrile neutropenia (16%), which occurred at a similar rate in the placebo arm (16%). Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients in the RYDAPT arm versus 6% in the placebo arm. The most frequent (> 1%) Grade 3/4 adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the RYDAPT arm was renal insufficiency (1%). Excluding deaths due to disease progression, no fatal adverse reactions occurred in the study. Overall, the most frequent non-treatment related cause of death in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm was sepsis (2%) and occurred at a similar rate in the placebo arm (2%).

BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received BRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS). The COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib. The most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea (7%), vomiting (7%), and pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 14% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia (2%), fatigue (2%), and nausea (2%). Five percent (5%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 5 and Table 6 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

The BEACON CRC trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (> 480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 4.4 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and 1.6 months for patients treated with either irinotecan or infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA)/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in combination with cetuximab. The most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and rash. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 33% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were vomiting (4%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), pyrexia (3%), and diarrhea (3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 9% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were fatigue (2%), arthralgia (2%), and peripheral neuropathy (2%). Ten percent (10%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI.

The most common (> 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea (7%), vomiting (7%), and pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 14% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia (2%), fatigue (2%), and nausea (2%). Five percent (5%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 5 and Table 6 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC) The safety of BRAFTOVI 300 mg once daily in combination with cetuximab (400 mg/m2 initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly) was evaluated in 216 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (BEACON CRC). The BEACON CRC trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert™s syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (> 480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 4.4 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and 1.6 months for patients treated with either irinotecan or infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA)/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in combination with cetuximab. The most common (25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and rash. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 33% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were vomiting (4%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), pyrexia (3%), and diarrhea (3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 9% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were fatigue (2%), arthralgia (2%), and peripheral neuropathy (2%). Ten percent (10%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI. None of the adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI occurred in more than one patient (>0.5%).

The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent (or in combination with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine) in 511 patients in Study MDX010-20; YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a single agent in 471 patients in Study CA184-029; YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in 1,362 patients in CHECKMATE-214, CHECKMATE-142, CHECKMATE-227, and CHECKMATE-743; YERVOY 3 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in 456 patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-067, CHECKMATE-040, and another randomized trial; and to YERVOY 1 mg/kg, administered in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA. Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of YERVOY was evaluated in 643 previously treated patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in Study MDX010-20 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Study MDX010-20 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Patients received YERVOY 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion for 4 doses as a single agent (n=131), YERVOY with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (n=380), or gp100 peptide vaccine as a single agent (n=132). Patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 4 doses). The trial population characteristics were: median age 57 years (range: 19 to 90), 59% male, 94% White, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (56%).

Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma: In Combination with Nivolumab The safety of YERVOY in combination with nivolumab was evaluated in 1082 patients with previously untreated advanced RCC in CHECKMATE-214 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Patients received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=547) or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (n=535). The median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (range: 1 day to 21.4+ months) in YERVOY and nivolumab arm. In this trial, 57% of patients in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were exposed to treatment for greater than 6 months and 38% of patients were exposed to treatment for greater than 1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving YERVOY with nivolumab. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with YERVOY and nivolumab were diarrhea, pyrexia, pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis. In patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab, study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 31% and delayed for adverse reactions in 54%. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, nausea, cough, pyrexia, arthralgia, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies to other studies or to other products may be misleading. Eleven (1.1%) of 1024 evaluable patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies against ipilimumab in an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. This assay had substantial limitations in detecting anti-ipilimumab antibodies in the presence of ipilimumab. Seven (4.9%) of 144 patients receiving ipilimumab developed anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 7 (4.5%) of 156 patients receiving placebo for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma tested positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies using an ECL assay with improved drug tolerance. No patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. No infusion-related reactions occurred in patients who tested positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies. Of the 499 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-214 and CHECKMATE-142, 27 (5.4%) were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies; there were no patients with neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion reactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab antibodies. Of 483 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-227 Part 1, 8.5% were positive for treatment-emergent anti-ipilimumab antibodies. No patients had neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. In Part 1 of the same study, of 491 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies, 36.7% were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 1.4% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab. Of 305 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-9LA, 8% were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 1.6% were positive for anti-ipilimumab neutralizing antibodies. There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion reactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab antibodies. Of 308 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-9LA, 34% were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 2.6% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab. Of 271 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-743, 13.7% were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 0.4% were positive for anti-ipilimumab neutralizing antibodies. Of 269 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-743, 25.7% were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 0.7% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of YERVOY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Transfusional Iron Overload A total of 700 adult and pediatric patients were treated with Exjade (deferasirox) for 48 weeks in premarketing studies. These included 469 patients with beta-thalassemia, 99 with rare anemias, and 132 with sickle cell disease. Of these patients, 45% were male, 70% were Caucasian, and 292 patients were less than 16 years of age. In the sickle cell disease population, 89% of patients were black. Median treatment duration among the sickle cell patients was 51 weeks. Of the 700 patients treated, 469 (403 beta-thalassemia and 66 rare anemias) were entered into extensions of the original clinical protocols. In ongoing extension studies, median durations of treatment were 88-205 weeks. Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials. These studies varied in duration from 1 to 5 years. The discontinuation rate across studies in the first year was 46% (adverse events 20%, withdrawal of consent 10%, death 8%, other 4%, lab abnormalities 3%, and lack of efficacy 1%). Among 47 patients enrolled in the study of 5-year duration, 10 remained on Exjade at the completion of the study. Table 1 displays adverse reactions occurring in greater than 5% of Exjade-treated beta-thalassemia patients (Study 1), sickle cell disease patients (Study 3), and patients with MDS (MDS pool). Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and increases in serum creatinine were the most frequent adverse reactions reported with a suspected relationship to Exjade. Gastrointestinal symptoms, increases in serum creatinine, and skin rash were dose related. Table 1.

Increases in serum creatinine appeared to be dose related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In this study, 17 (6%) patients treated with Exjade developed elevations in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 2 consecutive visits. Of these, 2 patients had liver biopsy proven drug-induced hepatitis and both discontinued Exjade therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . An additional 2 patients, who did not have elevations in SGPT/ALT greater than 5 times the ULN, discontinued Exjade because of increased SGPT/ALT. Increases in transaminases did not appear to be dose related. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuations included abnormal liver function tests (2 patients) and drug-induced hepatitis (2 patients), skin rash, glycosuria/proteinuria, Henoch Schönlein purpura, hyperactivity/insomnia, drug fever, and cataract (1 patient each). In Study 3, a total of 48 (36%) patients treated with Exjade had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Of the patients who experienced creatinine increases in Study 3, 8 Exjade-treated patients required dose reductions. In this study, 5 patients in the Exjade group developed elevations in SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits and 1 patient subsequently had Exjade permanently discontinued. Four additional patients discontinued Exjade due to adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug, including diarrhea, pancreatitis associated with gallstones, atypical tuberculosis, and skin rash. In the MDS pool, in the first year, a total of 229 (37%) patients treated with Exjade had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 consecutive occasions (Table 2) and 8 (3.5%) patients permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . A total of 5 (0.8%) patients developed SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation included increases in serum creatinine, diarrhea, nausea, rash, and vomiting.

Serum creatinine returned to normal in all 3 patients (in 1 spontaneously and in the other 2 after drug interruption). Two additional cases of ALT increase and 2 additional cases of serum creatinine increase were observed in the 1-year extension of Study 5. The number (%) of patients with NTDT with increase in serum creatinine or SGPT/ALT in Study 5, Study 6, and Study 7 are presented in Table 4 below. Table 4.

Intermittent proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 0.6 mg/mg) occurred in 18.6% of Exjade-treated patients compared to 7.2% of deferoxamine-treated patients in Study 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Other Adverse Reactions In the population of more than 5,000 patients with transfusional iron overload who have been treated with Exjade during clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring in 0.1% to 1% of patients included gastritis, edema, sleep disorder, pigmentation disorder, dizziness, anxiety, maculopathy, cholelithiasis, pyrexia, fatigue, laryngeal pain, cataract, hearing loss, GI hemorrhage, gastric ulcer (including multiple ulcers), duodenal ulcer, renal tubular disorder (Fanconi Syndrome), and acute pancreatitis (with and without underlying biliary conditions). Adverse reactions occurring in 0.01% to 0.1% of patients included optic neuritis, esophagitis, erythema multiforme, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Adverse reactions, which most frequently led to dose interruption or dose adjustment during clinical trials were rash, GI disorders, infections, increased serum creatinine, and increased serum transaminases. Pooled Analysis of Pediatric Clinical Trial Data A nested case control analysis was conducted within a deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial dataset to evaluate the effects of dose and serum ferritin level, separately and combined, on kidney function. Among 1213 children (aged 2 to 15 years) with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 162 cases of acute kidney injury (eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and 621 matched-controls with normal kidney function (eGFR > 120 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were identified. The primary findings were: - A 26% increased risk of acute kidney injury was observed with each 5 mg/kg increase in daily Exjade dosage starting at 20 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.48). - A 25% increased risk for acute kidney injury was observed with each 250 mcg/L decrease in serum ferritin starting at 1250 mcg/L (95% CI: 1.01-1.56). - Among pediatric patients with a serum ferritin < 1,000 mcg/L, those who received Exjade dosage > 30 mg/kg/day, compared to those who received lower dosages, had a higher risk for acute kidney injury (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.25-15.95), consistent with overchelation. In addition, a cohort based analysis of ARs was conducted in the deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial data. Pediatric patients who received Exjade dose > 25 mg/kg/day when their serum ferritin was < 1,000 mcg/L (n = 158) had a 6-fold greater rate of renal adverse reactions (incidence rate ration (IRR) = 6.00, 95% CI: 1.75-21.36) and a 2-fold greater rate of dose interruptions (IRR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33-3.17) compared to the time-period prior to meeting these simultaneous criteria. Adverse reaction of special interest (cytopenia, renal, hearing, and GI disorders) occurred 1.9-fold more frequently when these simultaneous criteria were met, compared to preceding time-periods (IRR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05-3.48) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported during postapproval use of Exjade in the transfusional-iron overload setting. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, in which patients may have received concomitant medication, it is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), hypersensitivity vasculitis, urticaria, alopecia, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction and angioedema) Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure, tubulointerstitial nephritis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure Gastrointestinal Disorders: GI perforation Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: worsening anemia 5-Year Pediatric Registry In a 5-year observational study, 267 pediatric patients 2 to < 6 years of age (at enrollment) with transfusional hemosiderosis received deferasirox. Of the 242 patients who had pre- and post-baseline eGFR measurements, 116 (48%) patients had a decrease in eGFR of ≥ 33% observed at least once. Twenty-one (18%) of these 116 patients with decreased eGFR had a dose interruption, and 15 (13%) of these 116 patients had a dose decrease within 30 days. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation from the study included liver injury (n = 11), renal tubular disorder (n = 1), proteinuria (n = 1), hematuria (n = 1), upper GI hemorrhage (n = 1), vomiting (n = 2), abdominal pain (n = 1), and hypokalemia (n = 1).']","----------------------------Exjade is an iron chelator indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overloaddue to blood transfusions in patients 2 years of age and older.

Transfusional Iron Overload A total of 700 adult and pediatric patients were treated with Exjade (deferasirox) for 48 weeks in premarketing studies. These included 469 patients with beta-thalassemia, 99 with rare anemias, and 132 with sickle cell disease. Of these patients, 45% were male, 70% were Caucasian, and 292 patients were less than 16 years of age. In the sickle cell disease population, 89% of patients were black. Median treatment duration among the sickle cell patients was 51 weeks. Of the 700 patients treated, 469 (403 beta-thalassemia and 66 rare anemias) were entered into extensions of the original clinical protocols. In ongoing extension studies, median durations of treatment were 88-205 weeks. Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials. These studies varied in duration from 1 to 5 years. The discontinuation rate across studies in the first year was 46% (adverse events 20%, withdrawal of consent 10%, death 8%, other 4%, lab abnormalities 3%, and lack of efficacy 1%). Among 47 patients enrolled in the study of 5-year duration, 10 remained on Exjade at the completion of the study. Table 1 displays adverse reactions occurring in greater than 5% of Exjade-treated beta-thalassemia patients (Study 1), sickle cell disease patients (Study 3), and patients with MDS (MDS pool). Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and increases in serum creatinine were the most frequent adverse reactions reported with a suspected relationship to Exjade. Gastrointestinal symptoms, increases in serum creatinine, and skin rash were dose related. Table 1.

See also Table 2. In Study 1, a total of 113 (38%) patients treated with Exjade had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2) and 25 (8%) patients required dose reductions. Increases in serum creatinine appeared to be dose related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In this study, 17 (6%) patients treated with Exjade developed elevations in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 2 consecutive visits. Of these, 2 patients had liver biopsy proven drug-induced hepatitis and both discontinued Exjade therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. An additional 2 patients, who did not have elevations in SGPT/ALT greater than 5 times the ULN, discontinued Exjade because of increased SGPT/ALT. Increases in transaminases did not appear to be dose related. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuations included abnormal liver function tests (2 patients) and drug-induced hepatitis (2 patients), skin rash, glycosuria/proteinuria, Henoch Schönlein purpura, hyperactivity/insomnia, drug fever, and cataract (1 patient each). In Study 3, a total of 48 (36%) patients treated with Exjade had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Of the patients who experienced creatinine increases in Study 3, 8 Exjade-treated patients required dose reductions. In this study, 5 patients in the Exjade group developed elevations in SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits and 1 patient subsequently had Exjade permanently discontinued. Four additional patients discontinued Exjade due to adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug, including diarrhea, pancreatitis associated with gallstones, atypical tuberculosis, and skin rash. In the MDS pool, in the first year, a total of 229 (37%) patients treated with Exjade had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 consecutive occasions (Table 2) and 8 (3.5%) patients permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. A total of 5 (0.8%) patients developed SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation included increases in serum creatinine, diarrhea, nausea, rash, and vomiting. Death was reported in the first year in 52 (8%) of patients [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia Syndromes In Study 5, 110 patients with NTDT received 1 year of treatment with Exjade 5 or 10 mg/kg/day and 56 patients received placebo in a double-blind, randomized trial. In Study 6, 130 of the patients who completed Study 5 were treated with open-label Exjade at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day (depending on the baseline LIC) for 1 year [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In Study 7, 134 patients with NTDT of 10 years of age or older with iron overload, received Exjade for up to 5 years, at a starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day followed by dose adjustment at Week 4, and then approximately every 6 months thereafter based on LIC levels. Tables 3 and 4 display the frequency of adverse reactions in patients with NTDT. Adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug were Study 5. Table 3.

Three Exjade-treated patients (all in the 10 mg/kg/day group) had 2 consecutive serum creatinine level increases greater than 33% from baseline and greater than ULN. Serum creatinine returned to normal in all 3 patients (in 1 spontaneously and in the other 2 after drug interruption). Two additional cases of ALT increase and 2 additional cases of serum creatinine increase were Reference ID: 4645863                                                                                                                               observed in the 1-year extension of Study 5.

Proteinuria In clinical studies, urine protein was measured monthly. Intermittent proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 0.6 mg/mg) occurred in 18.6% of Exjade-treated patients compared to 7.2% of deferoxaminetreated patients in Study 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Other Adverse Reactions In the population of more than 5,000 patients with transfusional iron overload who have been treated with Exjade during clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring in 0.1% to 1% of patients included gastritis, edema, sleep disorder, pigmentation disorder, dizziness, anxiety, maculopathy, cholelithiasis, pyrexia, fatigue, laryngeal pain, cataract, hearing loss, GI hemorrhage, gastric ulcer (including multiple ulcers), duodenal ulcer, renal tubular disorder (Fanconi Syndrome), and acute pancreatitis (with and without underlying biliary conditions). Adverse reactions occurring in 0.01% to 0.1% of patients included optic neuritis, esophagitis, erythema multiforme, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Adverse reactions, which most frequently led to dose interruption or dose adjustment during clinical trials were rash, GI disorders, infections, increased serum creatinine, and increased serum transaminases. Pooled Analysis of Pediatric Clinical Trial Data A nested case control analysis was conducted within a deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial dataset to evaluate the effects of dose and serum ferritin level, separately and combined, on kidney function. Among 1213 children (aged 2 to 15 years) with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 162 cases of acute kidney injury (eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 621 matched-controls with normal kidney function (eGFR > 120 mL/min/1.73 m2) were identified. The primary findings were: -A 26% increased risk of acute kidney injury was observed with each 5 mg/kg increase in daily Exjade dosage starting at 20 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.48). -A 25% increased risk for acute kidney injury was observed with each 250 mcg/L decrease in serum ferritin starting at 1250 mcg/L (95% CI: 1.01-1.56). -Among pediatric patients with a serum ferritin < 1,000 mcg/L, those who received Exjade dosage > 30 mg/kg/day, compared to those who received lower dosages, had a higher risk for acute kidney injury (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.25-15.95), consistent with overchelation. In addition, a cohort based analysis of ARs was conducted in the deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial data. Pediatric patients who received Exjade dose > 25 mg/kg/day when their serum ferritin was < 1,000 mcg/L (n = 158) had a 6-fold greater rate of renal adverse reactions (incidence rate ration (IRR) = 6.00, 95% CI: 1.75-21.36) and a 2-fold greater rate of dose interruptions (IRR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33-3.17) compared to the time-period prior to meeting these simultaneous criteria. Adverse reaction of special Reference ID: 4645863                                                                                   interest (cytopenia, renal, hearing, and GI disorders) occurred 1.9-fold more frequently when these simultaneous criteria were met, compared to preceding time-periods (IRR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05-3.48) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported during postapproval use of Exjade in the transfusional-iron overload setting. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, in which patients may have received concomitant medication, it is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflects exposure to LORBRENA in 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily in Study B7461001 (N=327) and Study B7461006 (N=149). Among 476 patients who received LORBRENA, 75% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 61% were exposed for greater than 1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most frequent adverse reactions in ≥ 20% of 476 patients who received LORBRENA were edema (56%), peripheral neuropathy (44%), weight gain (31%), cognitive effects (28%), fatigue (27%), dyspnea (27%), arthralgia (24%), diarrhea (23%), mood effects (21%), and cough (21%). The most frequent Grade 3–4 laboratory abnormalities in ≥ 20% of 476 patients who received LORBRENA were hypercholesterolemia (21%) and hypertriglyceridemia (21%). Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC (CROWN Study) The safety of LORBRENA was evaluated in 149 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive, locally advanced or metastatic, NSCLC who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The median duration of exposure to LORBRENA was 16.7 months (4 days to 34.3 months) and 76% received LORBRENA for at least 12 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients treated with LORBRENA; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.7%), dyspnea (2.7%), respiratory failure (2.7%), cognitive effects (2.0%), and pyrexia (2.0%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients treated with LORBRENA and included pneumonia (0.7%), respiratory failure (0.7%), cardiac failure acute (0.7%), pulmonary embolism (0.7%), and sudden death (0.7%). Permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA due to adverse reactions occurred in 6.7% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA was cognitive effects (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions occurred in 49% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose interruptions of LORBRENA were hypertriglyceridemia (7%), edema (5%), pneumonia (4.7%) cognitive effects (4.0%), mood effects (4.0%), and hypercholesterolemia (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 21% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were edema (5%), hypertriglyceridemia (4.0%), and peripheral neuropathy (3.4%).

Follow-up is limited. Page 10Gleevec is also indicated for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosomepositive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or in chronicphase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy. Gleevec is also indicated for the treatment ofpediatric patients with  Ph+ chronic phase CML whose disease has recurred after stem celltransplant  or who are resistant to interferon alpha therapy.  There are no controlled trialsdemonstrating a clinical benefit, such as improvement in disease-related symptoms orincreased survival.Gleevec is also indicated for the treatment of patients with Kit (CD117) positiveunresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). (SeeCLINICAL STUDIES:  Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.) The effectiveness of Gleevec inGIST is based on objective response rate (see CLINICAL STUDIES). There are no controlledtrials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as improvement in disease-related symptoms orincreased survival. CONTRAINDICATIONS Use of GleevecŽ (imatinib mesylate) is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity toimatinib or to any other component of Gleevec.WARNINGSPregnancyWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.Imatinib mesylate was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis atdoses 100 mg/kg, approximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day (basedon body surface area). Teratogenic effects included exencephaly or encephalocele,absent/reduced frontal and absent parietal bones. Female rats administered doses 45 mg/kg(approximately one-half the maximum human dose of 800 mg/day, based on body surfacearea) also experienced significant post-implantation loss as evidenced by either early fetalresorption or stillbirths, nonviable pups and early pup mortality between postpartum days 0and 4. At doses higher than 100 mg/kg, total fetal loss was noted in all animals. Fetal loss wasnot seen at doses 30 mg/kg (one-third the maximum human dose of 800 mg).Male and female rats were exposed in utero to a maternal imatinib mesylate dose of45 mg/kg (approximately one-half the maximum human dose of 800 mg) from day 6 ofgestation and through milk during the lactation period. These animals then received noimatinib exposure for nearly 2 months. Body weights were reduced from birth until terminalsacrifice in these rats. Although fertility was not affected, fetal loss was seen when these maleand female animals were then mated.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If GleevecŽ(imatinib mesylate) is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking(receiving) Gleevec, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.Page 11PRECAUTIONS GeneralFluid Retention and Edema:  GleevecŽ (imatinib mesylate) is often associated with edemaand occasionally serious fluid retention (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should beweighed and monitored regularly for signs and symptoms of fluid retention. An unexpectedrapid weight gain should be carefully investigated and appropriate treatment provided. Theprobability of edema was increased with higher Gleevec dose and age >65 years in the CMLstudies. Severe superficial edema was reported in 0.9% of newly diagnosed CML patientstaking Gleevec, and in 2%-5% of other adult CML patients taking Gleevec. In addition,severe fluid retention (e.g., pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, andascites) was reported in 2%-8% of other adult CML patients taking Gleevec. There have beenpost-marketing reports, including fatalities, of cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure,and papilledema in patients with CML treated with Gleevec.Severe superficial edema and severe fluid retention (pleural effusion, pulmonaryedema and ascites) were reported in 1%-6% of patients taking Gleevec for GIST.GI Irritation:  Gleevec is sometimes associated with GI irritation. Gleevec should be takenwith food and a large glass of water to minimize this problem. Hemorrhage:  In the newly diagnosed CML trial, 0.7% of patients had grade 3/4 hemorrhage.In the GIST clinical trial seven patients (5%), four in the 600 mg dose group and three in the400 mg dose group, had a total of eight events of CTC grade 3/4 - gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds(3 patients), intra-tumoral bleeds (3 patients) or both (1 patient). Gastrointestinal tumor sitesmay have been the source of GI bleeds. Hematologic Toxicity:  Treatment with Gleevec is associated with anemia, neutropenia, andthrombocytopenia. Complete blood counts should be performed weekly for the first month,biweekly for the second month, and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated (for exampleevery 2-3 months). In CML, the occurrence of these cytopenias is dependent on the stage ofdisease and is more frequent in patients with accelerated phase CML or blast crisis than inpatients with chronic phase CML.

The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TRUSELTIQ as a single agent at 125 mg orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off therapy, in 28-day cycles in 351 patients in Study CBGJ398X2204 and in patients with other advanced solid tumors or hematological malignancies. Among 351 patients who received TRUSELTIQ, 27% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 10% were exposed for greater than one year.  Reference ID: 4803321                     Previously Treated, Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma  The safety of TRUSELTIQ was evaluated in Study CBGJ398X2204, which included 108 patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients were treated orally with TRUSELTIQ 125 mg once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off therapy, in 28-day cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0.03 to 28.3 months). The median age of TRUSELTIQ treated patients was 53 years (range 23-81), 62% were females, and 72% were White. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients receiving TRUSELTIQ. Serious adverse reactions in 2% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ included infections, anemia, pyrexia, abdominal pain, hypercalcemia, and sepsis. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient who received TRUSELTIQ and was due to sepsis. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 15% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Adverse reactions requiring permanent discontinuation in 1% of patients were blood creatinine increased, fatigue, subretinal fluid, and calcinosis.  Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 64% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in 5% of patients included hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, stomatitis, diarrhea, and blood creatinine increased. Dosage reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 60% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in 2% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ included hyperphosphatemia, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, increased blood creatinine, increased lipase, hypercalcemia, and onycholysis.  The most common (20%) adverse reactions were nail toxicity, stomatitis, dry eye, fatigue, alopplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, arthralgia, dysgeusia, constipation, abdominal pain, dry mouth, eyelash changes, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, vision blurred and vomiting.

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Complications of Allogeneic HSCT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were lymphopenia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, anemia, and hyperkalemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Regeneron at 1-877-542-8296 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LIBTAYO as a single agent in 810 patients in three open-label, single-arm, multicohort studies (Study 1423, Study 1540 and Study 1620), and one open-label randomized multi-center study (Study 1624). These studies included 219 patients with advanced CSCC (Studies 1540 and 1423), 132 patients with advanced BCC (Study 1620), 355 patients with NSCLC (Study 1624), and 104 patients with other advanced solid tumors (Study 1423). LIBTAYO was administered intravenously at doses of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=235), 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=543), or other doses (n=32; 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 200 mg every 2 weeks). Among the 810 patients, 57% were exposed for ≥ 6 months and 25% were exposed for ≥ 12 months. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were lymphopenia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, anemia, and hyperkalemia. Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) The safety of LIBTAYO was evaluated in 219 patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic or locally advanced disease) in Study 1423 and Study 1540 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Of these 219 patients, 131 had mCSCC (nodal or distant) and 88 had laCSCC. Patients received LIBTAYO 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=1), 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=162) or 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=56) as an intravenous infusion until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. The median duration of exposure was 38 weeks (2 weeks to 110 weeks). The safety population characteristics were: median age of 72 years (38 to 96 years), 83% male, 96% White, and European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (PS) of 0 (44%) and 1 (56%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients were pneumonitis, cellulitis, sepsis, and pneumonia. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were pneumonitis, cough, pneumonia, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, hepatitis, arthralgia, muscular weakness, neck pain, soft tissue necrosis, complex regional pain syndrome, lethargy, psoriasis, rash maculopapular, proctitis, and confusional state. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were cellulitis, anemia, hypertension, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, pneumonitis, sepsis, skin infection, and hypercalcemia.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to cemiplimab-rwlc in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were tested in 823 patients who received LIBTAYO. The incidence of cemiplimab-rwlc treatment-emergent ADAs was 2.2% using an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay; 0.4% were persistent ADA responses. In the patients who developed anti-cemiplimab-rwlc antibodies, there was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile of cemiplimab-rwlc.""]"," LIBTAYO is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody indicated: Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)    for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cellcarcinoma (mCSCC) or locally advanced CSCC (laCSCC) who are not   candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.

Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma with BRAF V600E Mutation This section describes adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from analyses of Trial 1 and Trial 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Trial 1 randomized (1:1) 675 treatment-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. In Trial 2, 132 patients with metastatic melanoma and failure of at least one prior systemic therapy received treatment with ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily. Table 1 presents adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients treated with ZELBORAF. The most common adverse reactions of any grade (≥ 30% in either study) in ZELBORAF-treated patients were arthralgia, rash, alopecia, fatigue, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pruritus, and skin papilloma. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 adverse reactions were cuSCC and rash. The incidence of Grade 4 adverse reactions was ≤ 4% in both studies. The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in Trial 1 was 7% for the ZELBORAF arm and 4% for the dacarbazine arm. In Trial 2, the incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication was 3% in ZELBORAF-treated patients.

The data described in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to ERBITUX in 1373 patients with SCCHN or CRC enrolled in clinical trials and treated at the recommended dosage for a median of 7 to 14 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most common adverse reactions in ERBITUX clinical trials (incidence ≥25%) include cutaneous adverse reactions (including rash, pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and infection. Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) In Combination with Radiation Therapy The safety of ERBITUX in combination with radiation therapy compared to radiation therapy alone was evaluated in BONNER. The data described below reflect exposure to ERBITUX in 420 patients with locally or regionally advanced SCCHN. ERBITUX was administered at the recommended dosage (400 mg/m 2 initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly). Patients received a median of 8 infusions (range 1 to 11) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Table 2 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions in BONNER. Table 2: Selected Adverse Reactions in ≥10% of Patients with Locoregionally Advanced SCCHN (BONNER) a Adverse Reaction ERBITUX with Radiation (n=208) Radiation Therapy Alone (n=212) Grades 1–4 b Grades 3 and 4 Grades 1–4 Grades 3 and 4 a Adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients in the ERBITUX combination arm and at a higher incidence (≥5%) compared to the radiation alone arm. b Adverse reactions were graded using the NCI CTC, version 2.0. c Includes cases also reported as infusion reaction. d Infusion reaction defined as any event described at any time during the clinical study as “allergic reaction” or “anaphylactoid reaction”, or any event occurring on the first day of dosing described as “allergic reaction”, “anaphylactoid reaction”, “fever”, “chills”, “chills and fever”, or “dyspnea”. e Based on laboratory measurements, not on reported adverse reactions, the number of subjects with tested samples varied from 205–206 for ERBITUX with Radiation arm; 209–210 for Radiation alone. f Acneiform rash defined as any event described as “acne”, “rash”, “maculopapular rash”, “pustular rash”, “dry skin”, or “exfoliative dermatitis”.

The following sites were affected: salivary glands (65% versus 56%), larynx (52% versus 36%), subcutaneous tissue (49% versus 45%), mucous membrane (48% versus 39%), esophagus (44% versus 35%), skin (42% versus 33%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late radiation toxicities was similar between the radiation therapy alone and the ERBITUX with radiation treatment groups. In Combination with Platinum-based Therapy and Fluorouracil The safety of a cetuximab product in combination with platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil or platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil alone was evaluated in EXTREME. The data described below reflect exposure to a cetuximab product in 434 patients with recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic SCCHN. Because ERBITUX provides approximately 22% higher exposure relative to the cetuximab product, the data provided below may underestimate the incidence and severity of adverse reactions anticipated with ERBITUX for this indication; however, the tolerability of the recommended dose is supported by safety data from additional studies of ERBITUX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Cetuximab was administered intravenously at a dosage of 400 mg/m 2 for the initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly. Patients received a median of 17 infusions (range 1 to 89) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Table 3 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions in EXTREME.

The majority of these events occurred in patients who received cisplatin and fluorouracil with or without cetuximab. Cardiac disorders were observed in 11% and 12% of patients who received cisplatin and fluorouracil with or without cetuximab, respectively, and 6% and 4% in patients who received carboplatin and fluorouracil with or without cetuximab, respectively. In both arms, the incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in the cisplatin and fluorouracil containing subgroup. Death attributed to cardiovascular events or sudden death was reported in 3% of the patients in the cetuximab with platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil arm and in 2% of the patients in the platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil alone arm. K-Ras Wild-type, EGFR-expressing, Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) In Combination with FOLFIRI The safety of a cetuximab product in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone was evaluated in CRYSTAL. The data described below reflect exposure to a cetuximab product in 667 patients with K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing, mCRC. ERBITUX provides approximately 22% higher exposure compared to this product; however, the safety data from CRYSTAL is consistent in incidence and severity of adverse reactions with those seen for ERBITUX in this indication. Cetuximab was administered intravenously at a dosage of 400 mg/m 2 initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly. Patients received a median of 24 infusions (range 1 to 224) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Serious adverse reactions included pulmonary embolism, which was reported in 4.4% of patients treated with cetuximab with FOLFIRI as compared to 3.4% of patients treated with FOLFIRI alone.

The most common adverse reactions were acneiform rash (88%), asthenia/malaise (73%), diarrhea (72%), and nausea (55%). The most common Grades 3–4 adverse reactions included diarrhea (22%), leukopenia (17%), asthenia/malaise (16%), and acneiform rash (14%). 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to cetuximab in the studies below with the incidence of antibodies to cetuximab in other studies or to other products may be misleading. An ELISA methodology was used to characterize the incidence of anti-cetuximab antibodies. The incidence of anti-cetuximab binding antibodies in 105 patients (from studies I4E-MC-JXBA, I4E-MC-JXBB, and I4E-MC-JXBD) with at least one post-baseline blood sample (≥4 weeks post first ERBITUX administration) was <5%. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ERBITUX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The median time on treatment in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily group was 61 months (range, 0.1 to 71 months). The median actual dose intensity was 593 mg/day in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily group. The most common (greater than 10%) non-hematologic adverse drug reactions were rash, pruritus, headache, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, myalgia, and upper abdominal pain. Constipation, diarrhea, dry skin, muscle spasms, arthralgia, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, vomiting, and asthenia were observed less commonly (less than or equal to 10% and greater than 5%) and have been of mild-to-moderate severity, manageable and generally did not require dose reduction. Increase in QTcF greater than 60 msec from baseline was observed in 1 patient (0.4%) in the 300 mg twice daily treatment group. No patient had an absolute QTcF of greater than 500 msec while on study drug. Clinical Trials Experience      Reference ID: 4713677   The most common hematologic adverse drug reactions (all Grades) were myelosuppression, including: thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia (15%), and anemia (8%). See Table 9 for Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, was observed in 10% of patients.  In Adult Patients with Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP In the single-arm, open-label multicenter clinical trial, a total of 458 patients with Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP resistant to or intolerant to at least one prior therapy, including imatinib were treated (CML-CP = 321; CML-AP = 137) at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily. The median duration of exposure in days for CML-CP and CML-AP patients is 561 (range, 1 to 1096) and 264 (range, 2 to 1160), respectively. The median dose intensity for patients with CML-CP and CML-AP is 789 mg/day (range, 151 to 1110) and 780 mg/day (range, 150 to 1149), respectively and corresponded to the planned 400 mg twice daily dosing. The median cumulative duration in days of dose interruptions for the CML-CP patients was 20 (range, 1 to 345), and the median duration in days of dose interruptions for the CML-AP patients was 23 (range, 1 to 234). In patients with CML-CP, the most commonly reported non-hematologic adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 10%) were rash, pruritus, nausea, fatigue, headache, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and myalgia. The common serious drug-related adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 1% and less than 10%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. In patients with CML-AP, the most commonly reported non-hematologic adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 10%) were rash, pruritus and fatigue. The common serious adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 1% and less than 10%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, leukopenia, intracranial hemorrhage, elevated lipase, and pyrexia.  Sudden deaths and QT prolongation were reported. The maximum mean QTcF change from baseline at steady-state was 10 msec. Increase in QTcF greater than 60 msec from baseline was observed in 4.1% of the patients and QTcF of greater than 500 msec was observed in 4 patients (less than 1%) [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].  Discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions was observed in 16% of CML-CP and 10% of CML-AP patients.  Most Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions Tables 7 and 8 show the percentage of adult patients experiencing non-hematologic adverse reactions (excluding laboratory abnormalities) regardless of relationship to study drug. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% of adult patients who received at least 1 dose of Tasigna are listed.

The rate of new musculoskeletal symptoms generally decreased in the second year after treatment discontinuation.  In the newly diagnosed population in whom musculoskeletal symptoms occurred at any time during the TFR phase, 23/53 (43.4%) had not resolved by the TFR end date or data cut-off date. In the population previously treated with imatinib in whom musculoskeletal events occurred at any time during the TFR phase, 32/57 (56.1%) had not resolved by the data cut-off date.  The rate of musculoskeletal symptoms decreased in patients who entered the Tasigna treatment reinitiation (NTRI) phase, at 11/88 (12.5%) in the newly diagnosed population and 14/56 (25%) in the population previously treated with imatinib. Other adverse reactions observed in the Tasigna re-treatment phase were similar to those observed during Tasigna use in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP and resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP.

In Pediatric Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP or Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML-CP  The data below reflect exposure to Tasigna from two studies in pediatric patients from 2 to less than 18 years of age with either newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP or imatinib/dasatinib resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP treated at the recommended dose of 230 mg/m2 twice daily (n = 69) [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The median time on treatment with Tasigna was 13.8 months (range, 0.7 to 30.9 months). The median actual dose intensity was 435.5 mg/m2/day (range, 149 to 517 mg/m2/day), and the median relative dose intensity was 94.7% (range, 32 to 112%). Forty patients (58.0%) had relative dose intensity superior to 90%.  In pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP, the most common (greater than 20%) non-hematologic adverse drug reactions were headache, rash, hyperbilirubinemia, alanine aminotransferase increased, pyrexia, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and vomiting. The most common (greater than 5%) Grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse drug reactions were alanine aminotransferase increased and hyperbilirubinemia. Laboratory abnormalities of hyperbilirubinemia (Grade 3/4: 13%) and transaminase elevation (AST Grade 3/4: 1%, ALT Grade 3/4: 9%), were reported at a higher frequency than in adult patients. The most common hematological adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 30% of patients, of all Grades) were decreases in total white blood cells (54%), platelet count (44%), absolute neutrophils (41%), absolute lymphocytes (32%), and hemoglobin (30%).  Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 9 patients (13%). The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were hyperbilirubinemia (6%) and rash (4%). Increase in QTcF greater than 30 msec from baseline was observed in 17 patients (25%). No patient had an absolute QTcF of greater than 500 msec or QTcF increase of greater than 60 msec from baseline.

In CLL/SLL, the safety population reflects exposure to VENCLEXTA as monotherapy in patients in M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175 and in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in patients in CLL14 and MURANO. In this CLL/SLL safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) for VENCLEXTA were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and edema. In AML, the safety population reflects exposure to VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine, azacitidine, or low-dose cytarabine in patients in M14-358, VIALE-A, and VIALE-C. In this safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥30% in any trial) were nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, constipation, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, anemia, rash, abdominal pain, sepsis, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and hypotension. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA in Combination with Obinutuzumab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) (N=212) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) (N=214) was evaluated in CLL14, a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial in patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients randomized to the VEN+G arm were treated with VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with VENCLEXTA as monotherapy for an additional six cycles. Patients initiated the first dose of the 5-week ramp-up for VENCLEXTA on Day 22 of Cycle 1 and once completed, continued VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for a total of 12 cycles. The trial required a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) >6 or CLcr <70 mL/min, hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin ≤2 times upper limit of normal and excluded patients with any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system. The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months) and the median number of cycles of obinutuzumab was 6 in the VEN+G arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm, most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5% each). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% (4/212) of patients, most often from infection. In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 21%, and dose interruption in 74%. Neutropenia led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 2% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 41%. Table 9 presents adverse reactions identified in CLL14. Table 9.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Rituximab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (VEN+R) (N=194) versus bendamustine in combination with rituximab (B+R) (N=188) was evaluated in MURANO [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients randomized to VEN+R completed the scheduled ramp-up (5 weeks) and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily, in combination with rituximab for 6 cycles followed by VENCLEXTA monotherapy, for a total of 24 months after ramp-up. At the time of analysis, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 22 months and the median number of cycles of rituximab was 6 in the VEN+R arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of the last VENCLEXTA treatment and/or 90 days of last rituximab were reported in 2% (4/194) of patients. In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia each led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 3% of patients. Neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients.

VENCLEXTA as Monotherapy The safety of VENCLEXTA was evaluated in pooled data from three single-arm trials (M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175). Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completing the ramp-up phase (N=352). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks. In the pooled dataset, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were White, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, with the most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most often (2 patients) from septic shock. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most frequent adverse reaction (≥5%) leading to dose reductions or interruptions was neutropenia (8%). Table 13 presents adverse reactions identified in these trials. Table 13.

Important Adverse Reactions in CLL/SLL Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating VENCLEXTA. CLL14 The incidence of TLS was 1% (3/212) in patients treated with VEN+G [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the trial. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events. MURANO The incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the trial, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.2 and 2.4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in Table 12 . Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032) In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . All events either met laboratory TLS criteria (laboratory abnormalities that met ≥2 of the following within 24 hours of each other: potassium >6 mmol/L, uric acid >476 µmol/L, calcium <1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/L), or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) ≥5 cm and/or absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥25 x 10 9 /L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CLcr ≥50 mL/min. Laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% all Grades, 1% Grade ≥3), hyperphosphatemia (14% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), hypocalcemia (16% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), and hyperuricemia (10% all Grades, <1% Grade ≥3). In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis. After this experience, TLS risk assessment, dosing regimen, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were revised [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . Acute Myeloid Leukemia VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (VEN+AZA) (N=283) versus placebo in combination with azacitidine (PBO+AZA) (N=144) was evaluated in VIALE-A, a double-blind, randomized trial, in patients with newly diagnosed AML [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity. Patients were randomized to receive VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo in combination with azacitidine. Among patients who received VEN+AZA, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 7.6 months (range: <0.1 to 30.7 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 83% of patients who received VEN+AZA, with the most frequent (≥5%) being febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%), and hemorrhage (6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients who received VEN+AZA, with the most frequent (≥2%) being pneumonia (4%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 3%), and hemorrhage (2%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 24% of patients, dose reductions in 2%, and dose interruptions in 72%. Adverse reactions which led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in ≥2% of patients were sepsis (excluding fungal; 3%) and pneumonia (2%). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to dose reduction was pneumonia (0.7%). Adverse reactions which required a dose interruption in ≥5% of patients included febrile neutropenia (20%), neutropenia (20%), pneumonia (14%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 11%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). Among patients who achieved bone marrow clearance of leukemia, 53% underwent dose interruptions for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/microliter.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine or Decitabine The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (N=67) or decitabine (N=13) was evaluated in M14-358, a non-randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed AML. At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle) or decitabine (20 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle). Azacitidine The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA when administered in combination with azacitidine was 6.5 months (range: 0.1 to 38.1 months). The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine in this trial is consistent with that of VIALE-A. Decitabine The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA when administered in combination with decitabine was 8.4 months (range: 0.5 to 39 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 85% of patients who received VENCLEXTA with decitabine, the most frequent (≥10%) being sepsis (excluding fungal; 46%), febrile neutropenia (38%), and pneumonia (31%). One (8%) fatal adverse reaction of bacteremia occurred within 30 days of starting treatment. Permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to permanent discontinuation (≥5%) was pneumonia (8%). Dosage reductions of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (≥5%) was neutropenia (15%). Dosage interruptions of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption (≥10%) were neutropenia (38%), febrile neutropenia (23%), leukopenia (15%), and pneumonia (15%).

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Low-Dose Cytarabine VIALE-C The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine (VEN+LDAC) (N=142) versus placebo with low-dose cytarabine (PBO+LDAC) (N=68) was evaluated in VIALE-C, a double-blind randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML. At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients were randomized to receive VENCLEXTA 600 mg orally once daily after completion of a 4-day ramp-up phase in combination with low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m 2 subcutaneously once daily on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo in combination with low-dose cytarabine. Among patients who received VEN+LDAC, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 3.9 months (range: <0.1 to 17.1 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of patients who received VEN+LDAC, with the most frequent (≥10%) being pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients who received VEN+LDAC, with the most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (6%) and sepsis (excluding fungal; 7%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 25% of patients, dose reductions in 9%, and dose interruptions in 63%. The most frequent adverse reaction (>2%) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA was pneumonia (6%). Adverse reactions which required a dose reduction in ≥1% of patients were pneumonia (1%) and thrombocytopenia (1%), and the adverse reactions which required a dose interruption in ≥5% of patients included neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (15%), pneumonia (8%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 6%). Among patients who achieved bone marrow clearance of leukemia, 32% underwent dose interruptions for ANC <500/microliter. Table 17 presents adverse reactions identified in VIALE-C. Table 17.

M14-387 The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine (N=61) was evaluated in M14-387, a non-randomized, open- label trial of patients with newly diagnosed AML [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity. Patients received VENCLEXTA 600 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with low-dose cytarabine (20mg/m 2 subcutaneously on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle). The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine is consistent with that of VIALE-C.', '6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse event rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In CLL/SLL, the safety population reflects exposure to VENCLEXTA as monotherapy in patients in M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175 and in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in patients in CLL14 and MURANO. In this CLL/SLL safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) for VENCLEXTA were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and edema. In AML, the safety population reflects exposure to VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine, azacitidine, or low-dose cytarabine in patients in M14-358, VIALE-A, and VIALE-C. In this safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥30% in any trial) were nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, constipation, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, anemia, rash, abdominal pain, sepsis, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and hypotension. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA in Combination with Obinutuzumab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) (N=212) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) (N=214) was evaluated in CLL14, a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial in patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients randomized to the VEN+G arm were treated with VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with VENCLEXTA as monotherapy for an additional six cycles. Patients initiated the first dose of the 5-week ramp-up for VENCLEXTA on Day 22 of Cycle 1 and once completed, continued VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for a total of 12 cycles. The trial required a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) >6 or CLcr <70 mL/min, hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin ≤2 times upper limit of normal and excluded patients with any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system. The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months) and the median number of cycles of obinutuzumab was 6 in the VEN+G arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm, most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5% each). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% (4/212) of patients, most often from infection. In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 21%, and dose interruption in 74%. Neutropenia led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 2% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 41%. Table 9 presents adverse reactions identified in CLL14. Table 9.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Rituximab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (VEN+R) (N=194) versus bendamustine in combination with rituximab (B+R) (N=188) was evaluated in MURANO [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients randomized to VEN+R completed the scheduled ramp-up (5 weeks) and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily, in combination with rituximab for 6 cycles followed by VENCLEXTA monotherapy, for a total of 24 months after ramp-up. At the time of analysis, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 22 months and the median number of cycles of rituximab was 6 in the VEN+R arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of the last VENCLEXTA treatment and/or 90 days of last rituximab were reported in 2% (4/194) of patients. In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia each led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 3% of patients. Neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients.

VENCLEXTA as Monotherapy The safety of VENCLEXTA was evaluated in pooled data from three single-arm trials (M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175). Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completing the ramp-up phase (N=352). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks. In the pooled dataset, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were White, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, with the most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most often (2 patients) from septic shock. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most frequent adverse reaction (≥5%) leading to dose reductions or interruptions was neutropenia (8%). Table 13 presents adverse reactions identified in these trials. Table 13.

Important Adverse Reactions in CLL/SLL Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating VENCLEXTA. CLL14 The incidence of TLS was 1% (3/212) in patients treated with VEN+G [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the trial. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events. MURANO The incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the trial, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.2 and 2.4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in Table 12 . Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032) In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . All events either met laboratory TLS criteria (laboratory abnormalities that met ≥2 of the following within 24 hours of each other: potassium >6 mmol/L, uric acid >476 µmol/L, calcium <1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/L), or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) ≥5 cm and/or absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥25 x 10 9 /L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CLcr ≥50 mL/min. Laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% all Grades, 1% Grade ≥3), hyperphosphatemia (14% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), hypocalcemia (16% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), and hyperuricemia (10% all Grades, <1% Grade ≥3). In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis. After this experience, TLS risk assessment, dosing regimen, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were revised [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . Acute Myeloid Leukemia VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (VEN+AZA) (N=283) versus placebo in combination with azacitidine (PBO+AZA) (N=144) was evaluated in VIALE-A, a double-blind, randomized trial, in patients with newly diagnosed AML [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity. Patients were randomized to receive VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo in combination with azacitidine. Among patients who received VEN+AZA, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 7.6 months (range: <0.1 to 30.7 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 83% of patients who received VEN+AZA, with the most frequent (≥5%) being febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%), and hemorrhage (6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients who received VEN+AZA, with the most frequent (≥2%) being pneumonia (4%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 3%), and hemorrhage (2%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 24% of patients, dose reductions in 2%, and dose interruptions in 72%. Adverse reactions which led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in ≥2% of patients were sepsis (excluding fungal; 3%) and pneumonia (2%). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to dose reduction was pneumonia (0.7%). Adverse reactions which required a dose interruption in ≥5% of patients included febrile neutropenia (20%), neutropenia (20%), pneumonia (14%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 11%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). Among patients who achieved bone marrow clearance of leukemia, 53% underwent dose interruptions for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/microliter.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine or Decitabine The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (N=67) or decitabine (N=13) was evaluated in M14-358, a non-randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed AML. At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle) or decitabine (20 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle). Azacitidine The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA when administered in combination with azacitidine was 6.5 months (range: 0.1 to 38.1 months). The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine in this trial is consistent with that of VIALE-A. Decitabine The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA when administered in combination with decitabine was 8.4 months (range: 0.5 to 39 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 85% of patients who received VENCLEXTA with decitabine, the most frequent (≥10%) being sepsis (excluding fungal; 46%), febrile neutropenia (38%), and pneumonia (31%). One (8%) fatal adverse reaction of bacteremia occurred within 30 days of starting treatment. Permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to permanent discontinuation (≥5%) was pneumonia (8%). Dosage reductions of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (≥5%) was neutropenia (15%). Dosage interruptions of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption (≥10%) were neutropenia (38%), febrile neutropenia (23%), leukopenia (15%), and pneumonia (15%). The most common adverse reactions (≥30%) were febrile neutropenia (69%), fatigue (62%), constipation (62%), musculoskeletal pain (54%), dizziness (54%), nausea (54%), abdominal pain (46%), diarrhea (46%), pneumonia (46%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 46%), cough (38%), pyrexia (31%), hypotension (31%), oropharyngeal pain (31%), edema (31%), and vomiting (31%). The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥30%) were neutrophils decreased (100%), lymphocytes decreased (100%), white blood cells decreased (100%), platelets decreased (92%), calcium decreased (85%), hemoglobin decreased (69%), glucose increased (69%), magnesium decreased (54%), potassium decreased (46%), bilirubin increased (46%), albumin decreased (38%), alkaline phosphatase increased (38%), sodium decreased (38%), ALT increased (31%), creatinine increased (31%), and potassium increased (31%). VENCLEXTA in Combination with Low-Dose Cytarabine VIALE-C The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine (VEN+LDAC) (N=142) versus placebo with low-dose cytarabine (PBO+LDAC) (N=68) was evaluated in VIALE-C, a double-blind randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML. At baseline, patients were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients were randomized to receive VENCLEXTA 600 mg orally once daily after completion of a 4-day ramp-up phase in combination with low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m 2 subcutaneously once daily on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo in combination with low-dose cytarabine. Among patients who received VEN+LDAC, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 3.9 months (range: <0.1 to 17.1 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of patients who received VEN+LDAC, with the most frequent (≥10%) being pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients who received VEN+LDAC, with the most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (6%) and sepsis (excluding fungal; 7%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 25% of patients, dose reductions in 9%, and dose interruptions in 63%. The most frequent adverse reaction (>2%) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA was pneumonia (6%). Adverse reactions which required a dose reduction in ≥1% of patients were pneumonia (1%) and thrombocytopenia (1%), and the adverse reactions which required a dose interruption in ≥5% of patients included neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (15%), pneumonia (8%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 6%). Among patients who achieved bone marrow clearance of leukemia, 32% underwent dose interruptions for ANC <500/microliter. Table 17 presents adverse reactions identified in VIALE-C. Table 17.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA in Combination with Obinutuzumab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) (N=212) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) (N=214) was evaluated in CLL14, a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial in patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients randomized to the VEN+G arm were treated with VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with VENCLEXTA as monotherapy for an additional six cycles. Patients initiated the first dose of the 5-week ramp-up for VENCLEXTA on Day 22 of Cycle 1 and once completed, continued VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for a total of 12 cycles. The trial required a total Cumulative Illness Rating  limit of normal and excluded patients with any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system. The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months) and the median number of cycles of obinutuzumab was 6 in the VEN+G arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm, most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5% each). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% (4/212) of patients, most often from infection. In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 21%, and dose interruption in 74%. Neutropenia led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 2% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 41%.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Rituximab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (VEN+R) (N=194) versus bendamustine in combination with rituximab (B+R) (N=188) was evaluated in MURANO [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients randomized to VEN+R completed the scheduled ramp-up (5 weeks) and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily, in combination with rituximab for 6 cycles followed by VENCLEXTA monotherapy, for a total of 24 months after ramp-up. At the time of analysis, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 22 months and the median number of cycles of rituximab was 6 in the VEN+R arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most  disease progression and within 30 days of the last VENCLEXTA treatment and/or 90 days of last rituximab were reported in 2% (4/194) of patients. In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia each led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 3% of patients. Neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients.

VENCLEXTA as Monotherapy The safety of VENCLEXTA was evaluated in pooled data from three single-arm trials (M13982, M14-032, and M12-175). Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completing the ramp-up phase (N=352). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks. In the pooled dataset, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were White, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most often (2 patients) from septic shock. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Important Adverse Reactions in CLL/SLL Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating VENCLEXTA. CLL14 The incidence of TLS was 1% (3/212) in patients treated with VEN+G [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the trial. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events. MURANO The incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the trial, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.2 and 2.4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]. All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily Reference ID: 4703575                                                                       dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]. Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in Table 12. Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032) In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2% [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]. All events either met    each other: potassium >6 mmol/L, uric acid >476 µmol/L, calcium <1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/L), or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph  absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 9/L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or sudden dLaboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% ahyperphosphatemia (14% a all Grades, 2% Grade  aIn the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis.

The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to KADCYLA as a single agent at 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) in 1624 patients including 884 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and 740 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (KATHERINE trial). Metastatic Breast Cancer In clinical trials, KADCYLA has been evaluated as single-agent in 884 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, increased transaminases, constipation and epistaxis. The adverse reactions described in Table 3 were identified in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in the EMILIA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients were randomized to receive KADCYLA or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The median duration of study treatment was 7.6 months for patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 5.5 months and 5.3 months for patients treated with lapatinib and capecitabine, respectively. In the EMILIA trial, 43% of patients experienced Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions in the KADCYLA-treated group compared with 59% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. Dose adjustments for KADCYLA were permitted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Thirty-two patients (7%) discontinued KADCYLA due to an adverse reaction, compared with 41 patients (8%) who discontinued lapatinib, and 51 patients (10%) who discontinued capecitabine due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to KADCYLA discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases. Eighty patients (16%) treated with KADCYLA had adverse reactions leading to dose reductions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of KADCYLA (in ≥ 1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, and peripheral neuropathy. Adverse reactions that led to dose delays occurred in 116 (24%) of KADCYLA treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to a dose delay of KADCYLA (in ≥ 1% of patients) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, fatigue, increased transaminases and pyrexia.

The most common adverse reactions leading to KADCYLA discontinuation (in ≥ 1% of patients) were platelet count decreased, blood bilirubin increased, ejection fraction decreased, AST increased, ALT increased, and peripheral neuropathy. Dose adjustments for KADCYLA were permitted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . One hundred and six patients (14%) treated with KADCYLA had dose reductions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of KADCYLA (in ≥ 1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, blood bilirubin and fatigue. Adverse reactions that led to dose delays occurred in 106 (14%) of KADCYLA treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to a dose delay of KADCYLA (in ≥ 1% of patients) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and AST increased. Selected laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 6 . The most common adverse reactions seen with KADCYLA in the randomized trial (frequency > 25%) were fatigue, nausea, increased transaminases, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgia.

A total of 1243 patients from seven clinical studies were tested at multiple time points for anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses to KADCYLA. Following KADCYLA dosing, 5.1% (63/1243) of patients tested positive for anti-KADCYLA antibodies at one or more post-dose time points. In clinical studies, 6.4% (24/376) of patients tested positive for anti-KADCYLA antibodies. In EMILIA, 5.2% (24/466) of patients tested positive for anti-KADCYLA antibodies, of which 13 were also positive for neutralizing antibodies. In KATHERINE, 3.7% (15/401) of patients tested positive for anti-KADCYLA antibodies, of which 5 were also positive for neutralizing antibodies. Due to the low incidence of ADA, conclusions cannot be made on the impact of anti-KADCYLA antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of KADCYLA. The presence of KADCYLA in patient serum at the time of ADA sampling may interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-KADCYLA antibodies. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-KADCYLA antibody development. Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to KADCYLA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Clinical significance of anti-KADCYLA antibodies is not yet known. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KADCYLA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies CHF and > 10% reduction in LVEF in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with a baseline LVEF of 40-49% treated with KADCYLA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with KADCYLA. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g., bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated.']"," KADCYLA is a HER2-targeted antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate indicated, as a single agent, for: the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination.

The adverse reactions described in Table 3 were identified in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in the EMILIA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients were randomized to receive KADCYLA or lapatinib plus capecitabine.  The median duration of study treatment was 7.6 months for patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 5.5 months and 5.3 months for patients treated with lapatinib and capecitabine, respectively. In the EMILIA trial, 43% of patients experienced Grade 3 adverse reactions in the KADCYLA-treated group compared with 59% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. Dose adjustments for KADCYLA were permitted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Thirty-two patients (7%) discontinued KADCYLA due to an adverse reaction, compared with 41 patients (8%) who discontinued lapatinib, and 51 patients (10%) who discontinued capecitabine due to an adverse reaction.  The most common adverse reactions leading to KADCYLA discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases.  Eighty patients (16%) treated with KADCYLA had adverse reactions leading to dose reductions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of KADCYLA (in  1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, and peripheral neuropathy. Adverse reactions that led to dose delays occurred in 116 (24%) of KADCYLA treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to a dose delay of KADCYLA (in  1% of patients) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, fatigue, increased transaminases and pyrexia.

The denominator varies based on data collected for each parameter (N=213 exceptphosphorous N=209).Elevated Bilirubin IDHIFA may interfere with bilirubin metabolism through inhibition of UGT1A1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Thirty-seven percent of patients (80/214) experienced total bilirubin elevations x ULN at least one time. Of those patients who experienced total bilirubin elevations 35% had elevations within the first month of treatment, and 89% had no concomitant elevation of transaminases or other severe adverse events related to liver disorders. No patients required a dose reduction for hyperbilirubinemia; treatment was interrupted in 3.7% of patients, for a median of 6 days. Three patients (1.4%) discontinued IDHIFA permanently due to hyperbilirubinemia. Noninfectious LeukocytosisIDHIFA can induce myeloid proliferation resulting in a rapid increase in white blood cell count.Tumor Lysis Syndrome IDHIFA can induce myeloid proliferation resulting in a rapid reduction in tumor cells which may pose a risk for tumor lysis syndrome.

At the time of the safety analysis, a total of 100 patients were enrolled in the trial, 16 of whom were enrolled in the ATC cohort. The primary safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of TAFINLAR or trametinib. Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among these 100 patients, 46 (46%) were exposed to TAFINLAR and trametinib for > 6 months and 23 (23%) were exposed to TAFINLAR 1 year. The median age was 59.5 years (range: 18 to 85); 62% were male; 85% were white; and 31% had baseline ECOG performance status 0 and 59% had ECOG performance status 1. The adverse reaction profile among all patients and among patients in the ATC cohort was similar to that observed in other approved indications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Because these reactions are reported voluntarilyfroma population of uncertainsize, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencyor establish a causal relationship to drugexposure.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia The majority of Gleevec-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. Gleevec was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 2.4% of patients receiving Gleevec in the randomized trial of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing Gleevec versus IFN+Ara-C, and in 12.5% of patients receiving Gleevec in the randomized trial of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing Gleevec and nilotinib. Gleevec was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 4% of patients in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, in 4% of patients in accelerated phase and in 5% of patients in blast crisis. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash (Table 2 and Table 3 for newly diagnosed CML, Table 4 for other CML patients). Edema was most frequently periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Gleevec [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)] . The frequency of severe superficial edema was 1.5%-6%. A variety of adverse reactions represent local or general fluid retention, including pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary edema, and rapid weight gain with or without superficial edema. These reactions appear to be dose related, were more common in the blast crisis and accelerated phase studies (where the dose was 600 mg/day), and are more common in the elderly. These reactions were usually managed by interrupting Gleevec treatment and using diuretics or other appropriate supportive care measures. These reactions may be serious or life threatening. Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the Gleevec-treated patients are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

The occurrence of cytopenias in CML patients was also dependent on the stage of the disease. In patients with newly diagnosed CML, cytopenias were less frequent than in the other CML patients (see Tables 5, 6, and 7). The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was between 2- and 3-fold higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase compared to chronic phase (see Tables 4 and 5). The median duration of the neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes varied from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 2 to 4 weeks, respectively. These reactions can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with Gleevec, but may require permanent discontinuation of treatment.

Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory abnormalities in less than 1.0% of CML patients. One patient, who was taking acetaminophen regularly for fever, died of acute liver failure. In the Phase 2 GIST trial, Grade 3 or 4 SGPT (ALT) elevations were observed in 6.8% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 SGOT (AST) elevations were observed in 4.8% of patients. Bilirubin elevation was observed in 2.7% of patients. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Population Single-Agent Therapy The overall safety profile of pediatric patients treated with Gleevec in 93 children studied was similar to that found in studies with adult patients, except that musculoskeletal pain was less frequent (20.5%) and peripheral edema was not reported. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported individual adverse reactions with an incidence similar to that seen in adult patients. Most patients experienced adverse reactions at some time during the study. The incidence of Grade 3/4 events across all types of adverse reactions was 75%; the events with the highest Grade 3/4 incidence in CML pediatric patients were mainly related to myelosuppression. In Combination with Multi-Agent Chemotherapy Pediatric and young adult patients with very high risk ALL, defined as those with an expected 5 year event-free survival (EFS) less than 45%, were enrolled after induction therapy on a multicenter, non-randomized cooperative group pilot protocol. The study population included patients with a median age of 10 years (1 to 21 years), 61% of whom were male, 75% were white, 7% were black, and 6% were Asian/Pacific Islander. Patients with Ph+ ALL (n = 92) were assigned to receive Gleevec and treated in 5 successive cohorts. Gleevec exposure was systematically increased in successive cohorts by earlier introduction and more prolonged duration. The safety of Gleevec given in combination with intensive chemotherapy was evaluated by comparing the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, neutropenia (less than 750/mcL) and thrombocytopenia (less than 75,000/mcL) in the 92 patients with Ph+ ALL compared to 65 patients with Ph- ALL enrolled on the trial who did not receive Gleevec. The safety was also evaluated comparing the incidence of adverse events in cycles of therapy administered with or without Gleevec. The protocol included up to 18 cycles of therapy. Patients were exposed to a cumulative total of 1425 cycles of therapy, 778 with Gleevec, and 647 without Gleevec. The adverse events that were reported with a 5% or greater incidence in patients with Ph+ ALL compared to Ph- ALL or with a 1% or greater incidence in cycles of therapy that included Gleevec are presented in Table 8.

In women there was an increase in the frequency of neutropenia, as well as Grade 1/2 superficial edema, headache, nausea, rigors, vomiting, rash, and fatigue. No differences were seen that were related to race but the subsets were too small for proper evaluation. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia The adverse reactions were similar for Ph+ ALL as for Ph+ CML. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions reported in the Ph+ ALL studies were mild nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, muscle cramps, and rash. Superficial edema was a common finding in all studies and were described primarily as periorbital or lower limb edemas. These edemas were reported as Grade 3/4 events in 6.3% of the patients and may be managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or in some patients by reducing the dose of Gleevec. Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the patients treated with Gleevec for MDS/MPD in the Phase 2 study, are shown in Table 9.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea, nausea, ascites, muscle cramps, dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema, anemia, pruritus, rash, and lower respiratory tract infection. None of the 5 patients in the Phase 2 study with ASM discontinued Gleevec due to drug-related adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory values. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome and Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia The safety profile in the HES/CEL patient population does not appear to be different from the safety profile of Gleevec observed in other hematologic malignancy populations, such as Ph+ CML. All patients experienced at least one adverse reaction, the most common being GI, cutaneous and musculoskeletal disorders. Hematological abnormalities were also frequent, with instances of CTC Grade 3 leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and anemia. Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the 12 patients treated with Gleevec for DFSP in the Phase 2 study are shown in Table 10.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were edema, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, vomiting, myalgia, anemia, and anorexia. Drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in a total of 89 patients (5.4%). Superficial edema, most frequently periorbital or lower extremity edema was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Gleevec [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)] . Severe (CTC Grade 3/4) edema was observed in 182 patients (11.1%). Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the patients treated with Gleevec are shown in Table 12. Overall the incidence of all grades of adverse reactions and the incidence of severe adverse reactions (CTC Grade 3 and above) were similar between the two treatment arms except for edema, which was reported more frequently in the 800 mg group.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other clinical studies in other patient populations and include diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, edema, decreased hemoglobin, rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain. No new adverse reactions were reported in the adjuvant GIST-treatment setting that had not been previously reported in other patient populations, including patients with unresectable and/or malignant metastatic GIST. Drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in 57 patients (17%) and 11 patients (3%) of the Gleevec and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Edema, GI disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and diarrhea), fatigue, low hemoglobin, and rash were the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the time of discontinuation. In Study 2, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 15 patients (8%) and 27 patients (14%) of the Gleevec 12-month, and 36-month treatment arms, respectively. As in previous trials the most common adverse reactions were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, edema, decreased hemoglobin, rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with Gleevec are shown in Table 14 (Study 1) and Table 15 (Study 2). There were no deaths attributable to Gleevec treatment in either trial.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia The majority of Gleevec-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. Gleevec was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 2.4% of patients receiving Gleevec in the randomized trial of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing Gleevec versus IFN+Ara-C, and in 12.5% of patients receiving Gleevec in the randomized trial of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing Gleevec and nilotinib. Gleevec was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 4% of patients in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, in 4% of patients in accelerated phase and in 5% of patients in blast crisis. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash (Table 2 and Table 3 for newly diagnosed CML, Table 4 for other CML patients). Edema was most frequently periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Gleevec [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)]. The frequency of severe superficial edema was 1.5%Œ6%. A variety of adverse reactions represent local or general fluid retention, including pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary edema and rapid weight gain with or without superficial edema. These reactions appear to be dose related, were more common in the blast crisis and accelerated phase studies (where the dose was 600 mg/day), and are more common in the elderly. These reactions were usually managed by interrupting Gleevec treatment and using diuretics or other appropriate supportive care measures. These reactions may be serious or life threatening. Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the Gleevec treated patients are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

Hematologic and Biochemistry Laboratory Abnormalities Cytopenias, and particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, were a consistent finding in all studies, with a higher frequency at doses greater than or equal to 750 mg (Phase 1 study). The occurrence of cytopenias in CML patients was also dependent on the stage of the disease. In patients with newly diagnosed CML, cytopenias were less frequent than in the other CML patients (see Tables 5, 6, and 7). The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was between 2-and 3-fold higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase compared to chronic phase (see Tables 4 and 5). The median duration of the neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes varied from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 2 to 4 weeks, respectively. These reactions can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with Gleevec, but may require permanent discontinuation of treatment.

Hepatotoxicity Severe elevation of transaminases or bilirubin occurred in approximately 5% of CML patients (see Tables 6 and 7) and were usually managed with dose reduction or interruption (the median duration of these episodes was approximately 1 week). Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory abnormalities in less than 1.0% of CML patients. One patient, who was taking acetaminophen regularly for fever, died of acute liver failure. In the Phase 2 GIST trial, Grade 3 or 4 SGPT (ALT) elevations were observed in 6.8% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 SGOT (AST) elevations were observed in 4.8% of patients. Bilirubin elevation was observed in 2.7% of patients. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Population Single-agent Therapy The overall safety profile of pediatric patients treated with Gleevec in 93 children studied was similar to that found in studies with adult patients, except that musculoskeletal pain was less frequent (20.5%) and peripheral edema was not reported. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported individual adverse reactions with an incidence similar to that seen in adult patients. Most patients experienced adverse reactions at some time during the study. The incidence of Grade 3/4 events across all types of adverse reactions was 75%; the events with the highest Grade 3/4 incidence in CML pediatric patients were mainly related to myelosuppression. In Combination with Multi-agent Chemotherapy Pediatric and young adult patients with very high risk ALL, defined as those with an expected 5 year event-free survival (EFS) less than 45%, were enrolled after induction therapy on a multicenter, non-randomized cooperative group pilot protocol. The study population included patients with a median age of 10 years (1 to 21 years), 61% of whom were male, 75% were white, 7% were black and 6% were Asian/Pacific Islander. Patients with Ph+ ALL (n = 92) were assigned to receive Gleevec and treated in 5 successive cohorts. Gleevec exposure was systematically increased in successive cohorts by earlier introduction and more prolonged duration. The safety of Gleevec given in combination with intensive chemotherapy was evaluated by comparing the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, neutropenia (less than 750/mcL) and thrombocytopenia (less than 75,000/mcL) in the 92 patients with Ph+ ALL compared to 65 patients with Ph-ALL enrolled on the trial who did not receive Gleevec. The safety was also evaluated comparing the incidence of adverse events in cycles of therapy administered with or without Gleevec. The protocol included up to 18 cycles of therapy. Patients were exposed to a cumulative total of 1425 cycles of therapy, 778 with Gleevec and 647 without Gleevec. The adverse events that were reported with a 5% or greater incidence Reference ID: 4654232                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   in patients with Ph+ ALL compared to Ph-ALL or with a 1% or greater incidence in cycles of therapy that included Gleevec are presented in Table 8.

Adverse Reactions in Other Subpopulations In older patients (greater than or equal to 65 years old), with the exception of edema, where it was more frequent, there was no evidence of an increase in the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. In women there was an increase in the frequency of neutropenia, as well as Grade 1/2 superficial edema, headache, nausea, rigors, vomiting, rash, and fatigue. No differences were seen that were related to race but the subsets were too small for proper evaluation. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia The adverse reactions were similar for Ph+ ALL as for Ph+ CML. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions reported in the Ph+ ALL studies were mild nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, muscle cramps and rash. Superficial edema was a common finding in all studies and were described primarily as periorbital or lower limb edemas. These edemas were reported as Grade 3/4 events in 6.3% of the patients and may be managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or in some patients by reducing the dose of Gleevec. Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the patients treated with Gleevec for MDS/MPD in the Phase 2 study, are shown in Table 9. Reference ID: 4654232                                                                                               Table 9: Adverse Reactions Regardless of Relationship to Study Drug Reported (More than One Patient) in MPD Patients in the Phase 2 Study (greater than or equal to 10% All Patients) All Grades N=7 Preferred Term n (%) Nausea 4 (57.1) Diarrhea 3 (42.9) Anemia 2 (28.6) Fatigue 2 (28.6) Muscle Cramp 3 (42.9) Arthralgia 2 (28.6) Periorbital Edema 2 (28.6) Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis All ASM patients experienced at least one adverse reaction at some time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea, nausea, ascites, muscle cramps, dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema, anemia, pruritus, rash and lower respiratory tract infection. None of the 5 patients in the Phase 2 study with ASM discontinued Gleevec due to drug-related adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory values. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome and Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia The safety profile in the HES/CEL patient population does not appear to be different from the safety profile of Gleevec observed in other hematologic malignancy populations, such as Ph+ CML. All patients experienced at least one adverse reaction, the most common being gastrointestinal, cutaneous and musculoskeletal disorders. Hematological abnormalities were also frequent, with instances of CTC Grade 3 leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and anemia. Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the 12 patients treated with Gleevec for DFSP in the Phase 2 study are shown in Table 10.

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Unresectable and/or Malignant Metastatic GIST In the Phase 3 trials, the majority of Gleevec-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were edema, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, vomiting, myalgia, anemia, and anorexia. Drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in a total of 89 patients (5.4%). Superficial edema, most frequently periorbital or lower extremity edema was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Gleevec [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)]. Severe (CTC Grade 3/4) edema was observed in 182 patients (11.1%). Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the patients treated with Gleevec are shown in Table 12. Overall the incidence of all grades of adverse reactions and the incidence of severe adverse reactions (CTC Grade 3 and above) were similar between the two treatment arms except for edema, which was reported more frequently in the 800 mg group.

Adjuvant Treatment of GIST In Study 1, the majority of both Gleevec and placebo treated patients experienced at least one adverse reaction at some time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other clinical studies in other patient populations and include diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, edema, decreased hemoglobin, rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain. No new adverse reactions were reported in the adjuvant GIST treatment setting that had not been previously reported in other patient populations, including patients with unresectable and/or malignant metastatic GIST. Drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in 57 patients (17%) and 11 patients (3%) of the Gleevec and placebo treated patients respectively. Edema, gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and diarrhea), fatigue, low hemoglobin, and rash were the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the time of discontinuation. In Study 2, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 15 patients (8%) and 27 patients (14%) of the Gleevec 12-month and 36-month treatment arms, respectively. As in previous trials the most common adverse reactions were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, edema, decreased hemoglobin, rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to ZYKADIA 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions in 925 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC across seven clinical studies, including ASCEND-4 and ASCEND1, described below, a randomized active-controlled study, two single arm studies, and two dose-escalation studies. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies had received prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or crizotinib for NSCLC. Among these 925 patients the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 25% incidence) were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss. Approximately 45% of patients initiating treatment with ZYKADIA 750 mg under fasted conditions had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose reduction and 66% of patients had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose interruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 7 weeks. In ASCEND-8, a dose optimization study, ZYKADIA 450 mg daily with food (N = 89) was compared to 750 mg daily under fasted conditions (N = 90) in both previously treated and untreated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The overall safety profile of ZYKADIA 450 mg with food was consistent with ZYKADIA 750 mg fasted, except for a reduction in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (diarrhea 56%, nausea 45%, vomiting 35%) were reduced patient (1.1%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food, 10% of patients had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose reduction and 42% of patients had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose interruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 8 weeks. Reference ID: 4398282                                            Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety evaluation of ZYKADIA is based on ASCEND-4, an open-label, randomized, active-controlled multicenter study of 376 previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients. Patients received ZYKADIA 750 mg daily (N = 189) under fasted conditions or chemotherapy plus maintenance chemotherapy (N = 187). Chemotherapy regimens were pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus investigator™s choice of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin [area under the curve (AUC) of 5 -6 mg*min/mL] administered every 21 days. Patients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy without progressive disease received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as single-agent maintenance therapy every 21 days. The demographic characteristics of the study population were 57% female, median age 54 years (range: 22 to 81 years), 22% age 65 years or older, 54% White, 42% Asian, 2% Black, and 2% other races. Patients were enrolled in Europe (53%), Asia Pacific (42%), and South America (5%) regions. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (97%), never smoked (61%), and 32% had brain metastases at screening. The median duration of exposure to ZYKADIA was 18 months. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 72 patients (38%) treated with ZYKADIA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), pleural effusion (4%), vomiting (4%), nausea (3%), dyspnea (3%), hyperglycemia (3%), AST increased (2%), lung infection (2%), and pericardial effusion (2%). Among patients treated with ZYKADIA, dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 77%, dose reductions were required in 66%, and adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of therapy occurred in 12% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients treated with ZYKADIA, that led to dose interruptions or reductions were: ALT increased (48%), AST increased (34%), vomiting (15%), blood creatinine increased (14%), GGT increased (13%), diarrhea (13%), and nausea (13%). The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of ZYKADIA in 1% or more of patients in ASCEND-4 were blood creatinine increased (2.1%), amylase increased (1.1%), and lipase increased (1.1%). The following fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4 patients treated with ZYKADIA: myocardial infarction, respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, and unknown cause. Tables 3 and 4 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in ASCEND-4.

In the chemotherapy arm, one patient had baseline lipase laboratory assessments but no post-baseline assessment; 49 patients had post-baseline assessments. Previously Treated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety evaluation of ZYKADIA is based on 255 ALK-positive patients in ASCEND-1 (246 patients with NSCLC and 9 patients with other cancers who received ZYKADIA at a dose of 750 mg daily under fasted conditions). The median duration of exposure to ZYKADIA was 6 months. The study population characteristics were: median age 53 years, age less than 65 (84%), female (53%), Caucasian (63%), Asian (34%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (90%), never or former smoker (97%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (89%), brain metastases (49%), and number of prior therapies 2 or more (67%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients treated with ZYKADIA. The most frequent adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients, that led to dose reductions or interruptions were: increased ALT (29%), nausea (20%), increased AST (16%), diarrhea (16%), and vomiting (16%). Serious adverse drug reactions reported in 2% or more of patients in ASCEND-1 were convulsion, pneumonia, ILD/pneumonitis, dyspnea, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and nausea. Fatal adverse reactions in patients treated with ZYKADIA occurred in 5% of patients, consisting of: pneumonia (4 patients), respiratory failure, ILD/pneumonitis, pneumothorax, gastric hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, pulmonary tuberculosis, cardiac tamponade, and sepsis (1 patient each). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 10% of patients treated with ZYKADIA.

Among 1479 patients who received TAGRISSO, 81% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 60% were exposed for greater than one year. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions in ≥20% of 1479 patients who received TAGRISSO were diarrhea (47%), rash (45%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), nail toxicity (33%), dry skin (32%), stomatitis (26%), fatigue (21%), and cough (20%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in ≥20% of 1479 patients who received TAGRISSO were leukopenia (65%), lymphopenia (62%), thrombocytopenia (53%), anemia (47%), and neutropenia (33%).The data described below reflect exposure to TAGRISSO (80 mg daily) in 337 patients with EGFRmutation-positive resectable NSCLC, and 558 patients with EGFR mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC in three randomized, controlled trials [ADAURA (n=337), FLAURA (n=279), and AURA3 (n=279)]. Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug induced interstitial disease or radiation Reference ID: 47195826pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, serious arrhythmia or baseline QTc interval greater than 470 msec on electrocardiogram were excluded from enrollment in these studies.Adjuvant Treatment of EGFR Mutation-Positive NSCLCThe safety of TAGRISSO was evaluated in ADAURA, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive NSCLC who had complete tumor resection, with or without prior adjuvant chemotherapy. At time of DFS analysis, the median duration of exposure to TAGRISSO was 22.5 months.Serious adverse reactions were reported in 16% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most common serious adverse reaction (≥1%) was pneumonia (1.5%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were diarrhea (4.5%), stomatitis (3.9%), nail toxicity (1.8%) and rash (1.8%).Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 11% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO were interstitial lung disease (2.7%), and rash (1.2%).Tables 2 and 3 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in ADAURA.

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to Lynparza as a single agent in 2901 patients; 2135 patients with exposure to 300 mg twice daily tablet dose including five controlled, randomized, trials (SOLO-1, SOLO-2, OlympiAD, POLO, and PROfound) and to 400 mg twice daily capsule dose in 766 patients in other trials that were pooled to conduct safety analyses. In these trials, 56% of patients were exposed for 6 months or longer and 28% were exposed for greater than one year in the Lynparza group. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions in ≥10% of patients were nausea (60%), fatigue (55%), anemia (36%), vomiting (32%), diarrhea (24%), decreased appetite (22%), headache (16%), dysgeusia (15%), cough (15%), neutropenia (14%), dyspnea (14%), dizziness (12%), dyspepsia (12%), leukopenia (11%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). First-Line Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Advanced Ovarian Cancer SOLO-1 The safety of Lynparza for the maintenance treatment of patients with BRCA -mutated advanced ovarian cancer following first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy was investigated in SOLO-1 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily (n=260) or placebo (n=130) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of study treatment was 25 months for patients who received Lynparza and 14 months for patients who received placebo. Among patients who received Lynparza, dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 52% and dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 28%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or reduction of Lynparza were anemia (23%), nausea (14%), and vomiting (10%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients receiving Lynparza. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of Lynparza were fatigue (3.1%), anemia (2.3%), and nausea (2.3%).

Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma Previously Treated Metastatic Melanoma The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-037, a randomized, open-label trial in 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab-related Grade 4 adverse reactions (except for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, patients with a condition requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test for hepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (n=102): dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks or carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day to 13.8+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2 months (range: 1 day to 9.6+ months) in chemotherapy-treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 24% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 3% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year. The population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and the chemotherapy group were similar: 66% male, median age 59.5 years, 98% White, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage disease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease, and 18% had brain metastasis. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline (51% vs. 38%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty-six percent of patients receiving OPDIVO had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% to <5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase.

The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease and patients requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=206) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=205). The median duration of exposure was 6.5 months (range: 1 day to 16.6 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 47% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 12% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year. The trial population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and dacarbazine group: 59% male, median age 65 years, 99.5% White, 61% with M1c stage disease, 74% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 4% with brain metastasis, and 37% with elevated LDH at baseline. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with ECOG performance status 0 (71% vs. 59%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 7% of patients and dose interruption in 26% of patients; no single type of adverse reaction accounted for the majority of OPDIVO discontinuations. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients and at a higher incidence than in the dacarbazine arm) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and pruritus.

These trials excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or with symptomatic interstitial lung disease. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg over 60 minutes by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO-treated patients in CHECKMATE-017 was 3.3 months (range: 1 day to 21.7+ months) and in CHECKMATE-057 was 2.6 months (range: 0 to 24.0+ months). In CHECKMATE-017, 36% of patients received OPDIVO for at least 6 months and 18% of patients received OPDIVO for at least 1 year and in CHECKMATE-057, 30% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 20% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year. Across both trials, the median age of OPDIVO-treated patients was 61 years (range: 37 to 85); 38% were ≥65 years of age, 61% were male, and 91% were White. Ten percent of patients had brain metastases and ECOG performance status was 0 (26%) or 1 (74%). In CHECKMATE-057, in the OPDIVO arm, seven deaths were due to infection including one case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, four were due to pulmonary embolism, and one death was due to limbic encephalitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued in 11% of patients and was delayed in 28% of patients for an adverse reaction. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, dyspnea, pyrexia, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure. Across both trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite.

Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression, maximal clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 34 years (range: 18 to 72), 98% of patients had received autologous HSCT, none had received allogeneic HSCT, and 74% had received brentuximab vedotin. The median number of prior systemic regimens was 4 (range: 2 to 15). Patients received a median of 23 doses (cycles) of OPDIVO (range: 1 to 48), with a median duration of therapy of 11 months (range: 0 to 23 months). Eleven patients died from causes other than disease progression: 3 from adverse reactions within 30 days of the last nivolumab dose, 2 from infection 8 to 9 months after completing nivolumab, and 6 from complications of allogeneic HSCT. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients. Dose delay for an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients. OPDIVO was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥1% of patients were pneumonia, infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, colitis or diarrhea, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and rash. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) among all patients were upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, rash, nausea, and pruritus. Tables 27 and 28 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO (one Grade 3 and 12 Grade 2). The median time to onset was 4.5 months (range: 5 days to 12 months). All 13 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with resolution in 12. Four patients permanently discontinued OPDIVO due to pneumonitis. Eight patients continued OPDIVO (three after dose delay), of whom two had recurrence of pneumonitis. Peripheral neuropathy: Treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy was reported in 12% (31/266) of all patients receiving OPDIVO. Twenty-eight patients (11%) had new-onset peripheral neuropathy and 3 patients had worsening of neuropathy from baseline. The median time to onset was 50 (range: 1 to 309) days. Complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO: Of 17 patients with cHL from the CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039 trials who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with OPDIVO, 6 patients (35%) died from transplant-related complications. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe (Grade 3 to 4) or refractory GVHD. Hyperacute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (12%) and Grade 3 or higher GVHD was reported in 5 patients (29%). Hepatic VOD occurred in 1 patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Table 28 summarizes laboratory abnormalities in patients with cHL. The most common (≥20%) treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities included cytopenias, liver function abnormalities, and increased lipase. Other common findings (≥10%) included increased creatinine, electrolyte abnormalities, and increased amylase.

The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary histology, salivary gland or non-squamous histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma). Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=236) or investigator’s choice of either cetuximab (400 mg/m 2 initial dose intravenously followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly), or methotrexate (40 to 60 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly), or docetaxel (30 to 40 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly). The median duration of exposure to nivolumab was 1.9 months (range: 1 day to 16.1+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 18% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 2.5% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year. The median age of all randomized patients was 60 years (range: 28 to 83); 28% of patients in the OPDIVO group were ≥65 years of age and 37% in the comparator group were ≥65 years of age, 83% were male and 83% were White, 12% were Asian, and 4% were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (20%) or 1 (78%), 45% of patients received only one prior line of systemic therapy, the remaining 55% of patients had two or more prior lines of therapy, and 90% had prior radiation therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 49% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued in 14% of patients and was delayed in 24% of patients for an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in patients with SCCHN were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma and NSCLC. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, respiratory tract infection, and sepsis. The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator’s choice were cough and dyspnea. The most common laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥10% of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator’s choice were increased alkaline phosphatase, increased amylase, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, and increased TSH. Urothelial Carcinoma The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-275, a single arm trial in which 270 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma had disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or had disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 3.3 months (range: 0 to 13.4+). Forty-six percent (46%) of patients had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction. Fourteen patients (5.2%) died from causes other than disease progression. This includes 4 patients (1.5%) who died from pneumonitis or cardiovascular failure which was attributed to treatment with OPDIVO. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients. OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 17% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients were urinary tract infection, sepsis, diarrhea, small intestine obstruction, and general physical health deterioration. The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and decreased appetite.

These patients enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2 of CHECKMATE-040, a multicenter, multiple cohort, open-label trial [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . Patients were required to have an AST and ALT ≤5 x ULN and total bilirubin <3 mg/dL. The median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 5 months (range: 0 to 22+ months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 49% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pyrexia, ascites, back pain, general physical health deterioration, abdominal pain, pneumonia, and anemia. The toxicity profile observed in these patients with advanced HCC was generally similar to that observed in patients with other cancers, with the exception of a higher incidence of elevations in transaminases and bilirubin levels. Treatment with OPDIVO resulted in treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 AST in 27 (18%) patients, Grade 3 or 4 ALT in 16 (11%) patients, and Grade 3 or 4 bilirubin in 11 (7%) patients. Immune-mediated hepatitis requiring systemic corticosteroids occurred in 8 (5%) patients. The safety of OPDIVO 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was evaluated in a subgroup comprising 49 patients with HCC and Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis enrolled in Cohort 4 of the CHECKMATE-040 trial who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib. OPDIVO and ipilimumab were administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by single-agent OPDIVO 240 mg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During the OPDIVO and ipilimumab combination period, 33 of 49 (67%) patients received all 4 planned doses of OPDIVO and ipilimumab. During the entire treatment period, the median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 5.1 months (range: 0 to 35+ months) and to ipilimumab was 2.1 months (range: 0 to 4.5 months). Forty-seven percent of patients were exposed to treatment for >6 months, and 35% of patients were exposed to treatment for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 29% of patients and delayed in 65% of patients for an adverse reaction. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (reported in ≥4% of patients) were pyrexia, diarrhea, anemia, increased AST, adrenal insufficiency, ascites, esophageal varices hemorrhage, hyponatremia, increased blood bilirubin, and pneumonitis. Tables 33 and 34 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in CHECKMATE-040.

In patients who received single-agent OPDIVO, virologic breakthrough occurred in 5 of 47 (11%) patients and 1 of 32 (3%) patients with active HBV or HCV at baseline, respectively. HBV virologic breakthrough was defined as at least a 1 log increase in HBV DNA for those patients with detectable HBV DNA at baseline. HCV virologic breakthrough was defined as a 1 log increase in HCV RNA from baseline. Esophageal Cancer Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-577, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multicenter trial in 792 treated patients with completely resected (negative margins) esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had residual pathologic disease following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The trial excluded patients who did not receive concurrent CRT prior to surgery, had stage IV resectable disease, autoimmune disease, or any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications. Patients received either OPDIVO 240 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 16 weeks followed by 480 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 4 weeks beginning at week 17. Patients were treated until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 1 year total duration. The median duration of exposure was 10.1 months (range: <0.1 to 14 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 9 months (range: <0.1 to 15 months) in placebo-treated patients. Among patients who received OPDIVO, 61% were exposed for >6 months and 54% were exposed for >9 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving OPDIVO. A serious adverse reaction reported in ≥2% of patients who received OPDIVO was pneumonitis. A fatal adverse reaction of myocardial infarction occurred in one patient who received OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued in 12% of patients and was delayed in 28% of patients for an adverse reaction.

The trial excluded patients who were refractory or intolerant to taxane therapy, had brain metastases that were symptomatic or required treatment, had autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, had apparent tumor invasion of organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor or had stents in the esophagus or respiratory tract. Patients received OPDIVO 240 mg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (n=209) or investigator’s choice: docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=65) or paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by 1 week off (n=143). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 2.6 months (range: 0 to 29.2 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 2.6 months (range: 0 to 21.4 months) in docetaxel- or paclitaxel-treated patients. Among patients who received OPDIVO, 26% were exposed for >6 months and 10% were exposed for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients who received OPDIVO were pneumonia, esophageal fistula, interstitial lung disease and pyrexia. The following fatal adverse reactions occurred in patients who received OPDIVO: interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (1.4%), pneumonia (1.0%), septic shock (0.5%), esophageal fistula (0.5%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), pulmonary embolism (0.5%), and sudden death (0.5%).

The trial excluded patients who were known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, or had untreated CNS metastases. Patients were randomized to receive OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients received one of the following treatments: • OPDIVO 240 mg in combination with mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) every 2 weeks or mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks. • OPDIVO 360 mg in combination with CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) every 3 weeks or CapeOX every 3 weeks. Patients were treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy or chemotherapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years. The median duration of exposure was 6.8 months (range: 0 to 33.5 months) in OPDIVO and chemotherapy-treated patients. Among patients who received OPDIVO and chemotherapy, 54% were exposed for >6 months and 28% were exposed for >1 year. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 16 (2.0%) patients who were treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy; these included pneumonitis (4 patients), febrile neutropenia (2 patients), stroke (2 patients), gastrointestinal toxicity, intestinal mucositis, septic shock, pneumonia, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, mesenteric vessel thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy. OPDIVO and/or chemotherapy were discontinued in 44% of patients and at least one dose was withheld in 76% of patients due to an adverse reaction. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy were vomiting (3.7%), pneumonia (3.6%), anemia (3.6%), pyrexia (2.8%), diarrhea (2.7%), febrile neutropenia (2.6%), and pneumonitis (2.4%). The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of patients treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy were peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, constipation, and musculoskeletal pain.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to OPDIVO with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Of the 2085 patients who were treated with OPDIVO as a single agent at dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, 11% tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-nivolumab antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay and 0.7% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab. There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile or increased incidence of infusion-related reactions with anti-nivolumab antibody development. Of the patients with melanoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, and malignant pleural mesothelioma who were treated with OPDIVO and ipilimumab and evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-nivolumab antibodies was 26% (132/516) with OPDIVO 3 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 36.7% (180/491) and 25.7% (69/269) with OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg every 6 weeks in non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma patients, respectively, and 38% (149/394) with OPDIVO 1 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The incidence of neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab was 0.8% (4/516) with OPDIVO 3 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 1.4% (7/491) and 0.7% (2/269) with OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg every 6 weeks in non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma patients, respectively, and 4.6% (18/394) with OPDIVO 1 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with OPDIVO and ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by OPDIVO every 2 weeks and were evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-nivolumab antibodies was 45% (20/44) with OPDIVO 3 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and 56% (27/48) with OPDIVO 1 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; the corresponding incidence of neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab was 14% (6/44) and 23% (11/48), respectively. Of the patients with NSCLC who were treated with OPDIVO 360 mg every 3 weeks in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and were evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-nivolumab antibodies was 34% (104/308); the incidence of neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab was 2.6% (8/308). There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion-related reactions with anti-nivolumab antibody development. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OPDIVO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The safety of IRESSA is based on the data from 2462 patients with NSCLC who received IRESSA 250 mg daily monotherapy in three randomized clinical studies (Study 2, Study 3 and Study 4). Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial disease, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease were excluded from these studies. Controlled Studies: Study 2 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in which 1217 patients were randomized to receive first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; 607 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 589 patients received carboplatin/paclitaxel. The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 5.9 months. The study population characteristics were: median age 57 years, age less than 65 years (73%), female (79%), Asian (100%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (100%), never smoker (94%), light ex-smoker (6%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (90%). Study 3 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 1692 patients were randomized to receive second- or third-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; of which 1126 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 562 patients received placebo. The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 2.9 months. The study population characteristics were: median age 62 years, age less than 65 years (60%), female (33%), Caucasian (75%), Asian (21%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (48%), never smoker (22%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (65%), PS 2 (29%), PS 3 (5%) and two or more prior therapies (51%). Study 4 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in which 1466 patients were randomized to receive second-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; 729 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 715 patients received docetaxel. The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 2.4 months. The study population characteristics were: median age 61 years, age less than 65 years (61%), female (36%), Caucasian (79%), Asian (21%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (54%), never smoker (20%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (88%) and two or more prior therapies (16%). The pooled safety database from the three randomized trials was used to evaluate for serious and uncommon adverse drug reactions. Common adverse reactions were evaluated in Study 3. The most frequent adverse reactions in Study 3 (incidence of >20% and greater than placebo) reported in IRESSA-treated patients were skin reactions (47%) and diarrhea (29%). The most frequent fatal adverse reactions in IRESSA-treated patients were respiratory failure (0.9%), pneumonia (0.8%), and pulmonary embolism (0.5%). Approximately 5% of IRESSA-treated patients and 2.3% of placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in patients treated with IRESSA were nausea (0.5%), vomiting (0.5%) and diarrhea (0.4%).

The safety of IRESSA is based on the data from 2462 patients with NSCLC who received IRESSA 250 mg daily monotherapy in three randomized clinical studies (Study 2, Study 3 and Study 4).  Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial disease, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease were excluded from these studies. Controlled Studies: Study 2 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in which 1217 patients were randomized to receive first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; 607 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 589 patients received carboplatin/paclitaxel.  The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 5.9 months.  The study population characteristics were:  median age 57 years, age less than 65 years (73%), female (79%), Asian (100%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (100%), never smoker (94%), light ex-smoker (6%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (90%).  Study 3 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 1692 patients were randomized to receive second- or third-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; of which 1126 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 562 patients received placebo.  The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 2.9 months.  The study population characteristics were:  median age 62 years, age less than 65 years (60%), female (33%), Caucasian (75%), Asian (21%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (48%), never smoker (22%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (65%), PS 2 (29%), PS 3 (5%) and two or more prior therapies (51%).    Study 4 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in which 1466 patients were randomized to receive second-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; 729 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 715 patients received docetaxel.  The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 2.4 months.  The study population characteristics were: median age 61  Reference ID: 4790286 years, age less than 65 years (61%), female (36%), Caucasian (79%), Asian (21%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology  (54%), never smoker (20%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (88%) and two or more prior therapies (16%). The pooled safety database from the three randomized trials was used to evaluate for serious and uncommon adverse drug reactions.  Common adverse reactions were evaluated in Study 3.  The most frequent adverse reactions in Study 3 (incidence of >20% and greater than placebo) reported in IRESSA-treated patients were skin reactions (47%) and diarrhea (29%).  The most frequent fatal adverse reactions in IRESSA-treated patients were respiratory failure (0.9%), pneumonia (0.8%), and pulmonary embolism (0.5%). Approximately 5% of IRESSA-treated patients and 2.3% of placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.  The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in patients treated with IRESSA were nausea (0.5%), vomiting (0.5%) and diarrhea (0.4%).

The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to GILOTRIF for clinically significant adverse reactions in 4257 patients enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=229) and LUX-Lung 8 (n=392), and 3636 patients with cancer enrolled in 42 studies of GILOTRIF administered alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic drugs at GILOTRIF doses ranging from 10-70 mg daily or at doses 10-160 mg in other regimens. The mean exposure was 5.5 months. The population included patients with various cancers, the most common of which were NSCLC, breast, colorectal, brain, and head and neck. The data described below reflect exposure to GILOTRIF as a single agent in LUX-Lung 3, a randomized, active-controlled trial conducted in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC, and in LUX-Lung 8, a randomized, active-controlled trial in patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy. Reference ID: 4505423                                                                                                              EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety of GILOTRIF was evaluated in 229 EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naïve patients with EGFR mutation-positive, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a randomized (2:1), multicenter, open-label trial (LUX-Lung 3). Patients received either GILOTRIF 40 mg daily until documented disease progression or intolerance to the therapy or pemetrexed 500 mg/m² followed after 30 minutes by cisplatin 75 mg/m² every three weeks for a maximum of six treatment courses. The median exposure was 11 months for patients treated with GILOTRIF and 3.4 months for patients treated with pemetrexed/cisplatin. The overall trial population had a median age of 61 years; 61% of patients in the GILOTRIF arm and 60% of patients in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm were younger than 65 years. A total of 64% of patients on GILOTRIF and 67% of pemetrexed/cisplatin patients were female. More than two-thirds of patients were from Asia (GILOTRIF 70%; pemetrexed/cisplatin 72%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 29% of patients treated with GILOTRIF. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (6.6%); vomiting (4.8%); and dyspnea, fatigue, and hypokalemia (1.7% each). Fatal adverse reactions in GILOTRIF-treated patients in LUX-Lung 3 included pulmonary toxicity/ILD-like adverse reactions (1.3%), sepsis (0.43%), and pneumonia (0.43%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 57% of GILOTRIF-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (20%), rash/acne (19%), paronychia (14%), and stomatitis (10%). Discontinuation of therapy in GILOTRIF-treated patients for adverse reactions was 14.0%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in GILOTRIF-treated patients were diarrhea (1.3%), ILD (0.9%), and paronychia (0.9%). Clinical trials of GILOTRIF excluded patients with an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), i.e., below the institutional lower limit of normal. In LUX-Lung 3, all patients were evaluated for LVEF at screening and every 9 weeks thereafter in the GILOTRIF-treated group and as needed in the pemetrexed/cisplatin group. More GILOTRIF-treated patients (2.2%; n=5) experienced ventricular dysfunction (defined as diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, or ventricular dilation; all < Grade 3) compared to chemotherapy-treated patients (0.9%; n=1).

Patients were required to have received at least four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients received GILOTRIF 40 mg once daily (n=392) or erlotinib 150 mg once daily (n=395). Treatment continued until documented disease progression or intolerance to the therapy. The median exposure was 2.1 months for patients treated with GILOTRIF, 15% were exposed for at least 6 months, and 5% were exposed for at least 12 months. Among the 392 GILOTRIF-treated patients, the median age was 65 years, 53% were 65 years of age or older, 84% were male, 72% were White, 25% were Asian, ECOG PS 0 (32%) or 1 (68%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with GILOTRIF. The most frequent serious adverse reactions in patients treated with GILOTRIF were pneumonia (6.6%), diarrhea (4.6%), and dehydration and dyspnea (3.1% each). Fatal adverse reactions in GILOTRIF-treated patients included ILD (0.5%), pneumonia (0.3%), respiratory failure (0.3%), acute renal failure (0.3%), and general physical health deterioration (0.3%). The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in GILOTRIF-treated patients were diarrhea (4.1%) and rash/acne (2.6%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 27% of GILOTRIF-treated patients and discontinuation of GILOTRIF for adverse reactions was required for 20%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (15%), rash/acne (5.9%), and stomatitis (3.1%).

The data described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ as a single-agent in 2616 patients in two randomized, active-controlled studies (POPLAR, OAK) and four open-label, single arm studies (PCD4989g, IMvigor210, BIRCH, FIR) which enrolled 524 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 1636 patients with metastatic NSCLC, and 456 patients with other tumor types. TECENTRIQ was administered at a dose of 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in all studies except PCD4989g. Among the 2616 patients who received a single-agent TECENTRIQ, 36% were exposed for longer than 6 months and 20% were exposed for longer than 12 months. Using the dataset described for patients who received TECENTRIQ as a single-agent, the most common adverse reactions in ≥ 20% of patients were fatigue/asthenia (48%), decreased appetite (25%), nausea (24%), cough (22%), and dyspnea (22%). In addition, the data reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ in combination with other antineoplastic drugs in 2421 patients with NSCLC (N = 2223) or SCLC (N = 198) enrolled in five randomized, active-controlled trials, including IMpower150, IMpower130 and IMpower133. Among the 2421 patients, 53% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 6 months and 29% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 12 months. Among the 2421 patients with NSCLC and SCLC who received TECENTRIQ in combination with other antineoplastic drugs, the most common adverse reactions in ≥20% of patients were fatigue/asthenia (49%), nausea (38%), alopecia (35%), constipation (29%), diarrhea (28%) and decreased appetite (27%). The data also reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ administered in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib in 230 patients enrolled in IMspire150. Among the 230 patients, 62% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 6 months and 42% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 12 months. Urothelial Carcinoma Cisplatin-Ineligible Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma The safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that included 119 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and were either previously untreated or had disease progression at least 12 months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until either unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The median duration of exposure was 15 weeks (0 to 87 weeks). Five patients (4.2%) who were treated with TECENTRIQ experienced one of the following events which led to death: sepsis, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, or respiratory distress. One additional patient (0.8%) was experiencing herpetic meningoencephalitis and disease progression at the time of death. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and renal failure. TECENTRIQ was discontinued for adverse reactions in 4.2% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were diarrhea/colitis (1.7%), fatigue (0.8%), hypersensitivity (0.8%), and dyspnea (0.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption occurred in 35% of patients; the most common (≥ 1%) were intestinal obstruction, fatigue, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, infusion-related reaction, cough, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, pyrexia, respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, creatinine increase, decreased appetite, hyponatremia, back pain, pruritus, and venous thromboembolism.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to atezolizumab in the studies described above with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Among 565 patients with NSCLC in OAK, 30% tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at one or more post-dose time points. The median onset time to ADA formation was 3 weeks. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA also had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who were ADA positive by week 4 (21%; 118/560) appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 4 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 111 patients in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1), 48% tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA also had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposures. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 364 ADA-evaluable patients with NSCLC who received TECENTRIQ with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in IMpower150, 36% (n=132) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points and 83% of these 132 patients tested ADA positive prior to receiving the second dose of atezolizumab. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had lower systemic atezolizumab exposure as compared to patients who were ADA negative [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The presence of ADA did not increase the incidence or severity of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Among 434 patients with TNBC in IMpassion130, 13% tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Among 178 patients in PD-L1 positive subgroup with TNBC in IMpassion130, 12% tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are insufficient numbers of patients in the PD-L1 positive subgroup with ADA to determine whether ADA alters the efficacy of atezolizumab. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 315 ADA-evaluable patients with HCC who received TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab in IMbrave150, 28% (n=88) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points and 66% (58/88) of these 88 patients tested ADA-positive prior to receiving the third dose of TECENTRIQ. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had lower systemic atezolizumab exposure as compared to patients who were ADA-negative [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who were ADA-positive by week 6 (20%; 58/288) appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 6; [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 218 ADA-evaluable patients with melanoma who received TECENTRIQ in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib in IMspire150, 13% (n=29) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are insufficient numbers of patients with positive ADA to determine whether ADA alters the efficacy or incidence or severity of adverse reactions.']","TECENTRIQ is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody indicated: Urothelial Carcinoma for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: o are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] -approved test, or o are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 statusThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumorresponse rate and duration of response.

The adverse reaction information from clinical studies does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Safety data are presented from two clinical trials in which patients received Vectibix: Study 20020408, an open-label, multinational, randomized, controlled, monotherapy clinical trial (N = 463) evaluating Vectibix with best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC and Study 20050203, a randomized, controlled trial (N = 1183) in patients with mCRC that evaluated Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy versus FOLFOX chemotherapy alone. Safety data for Study 20050203 are limited to 656 patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. The safety profile of Vectibix in patients with wild-type RAS mCRC is similar with that seen in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. Vectibix Monotherapy In Study 20020408, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) with Vectibix were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common (> 5%) serious adverse reactions in the Vectibix arm were general physical health deterioration and intestinal obstruction. The most frequently reported adverse reactions for Vectibix leading to withdrawal were general physical health deterioration (n = 2) and intestinal obstruction (n = 2). For Study 20020408, the data described in Table 1 and in other sections below, except where noted, reflect exposure to Vectibix administered to patients with mCRC as a single agent at the recommended dose and schedule (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks).

In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients receiving Vectibix. Skin toxicity was severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients. Ocular toxicities occurred in 16% of patients and included, but were not limited to, conjunctivitis (5%). One patient experienced an NCI-CTC grade 3 event of mucosal inflammation. The incidence of paronychia was 25% and was severe in 2% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. In Study 20020408 (N = 229), median time to the development of dermatologic, nail, or ocular toxicity was 12 days after the first dose of Vectibix; the median time to most severe skin/ocular toxicity was 15 days after the first dose of Vectibix; and the median time to resolution after the last dose of Vectibix was 98 days. Severe toxicity necessitated dose interruption in 11% of Vectibix-treated patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Subsequent to the development of severe dermatologic toxicities, infectious complications, including sepsis, septic death, necrotizing fasciitis, and abscesses requiring incisions and drainage were reported. Vectibix in Combination w ith FOLFOX Chemotherapy The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC receiving Vectibix (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and FOLFOX therapy (N = 322) in Study 20050203 were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin (Table 2). Serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% difference between treatment arms) in Vectibix-treated patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC were diarrhea and dehydration. The commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 1%) leading to discontinuation in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC receiving Vectibix were rash, paresthesia, fatigue, diarrhea, acneiform dermatitis, and hypersensitivity. One grade 5 adverse reaction, hypokalemia, occurred in a patient who received Vectibix.

Infusion Reactions Infusional toxicity manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm or hypotension was assessed within 24 hours of an infusion during the clinical study. Vital signs and temperature were measured within 30 minutes prior to initiation and upon completion of the Vectibix infusion. The use of premedication was not standardized in the clinical trials. Thus, the utility of premedication in preventing the first or subsequent episodes of infusional toxicity is unknown. Across clinical trials of Vectibix monotherapy, 3% (24/725) experienced infusion reactions of which < 1% (3/725) were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). In one patient, Vectibix was permanently discontinued for a serious infusion reaction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) ] . 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to panitumumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The immunogenicity of Vectibix has been evaluated using two different screening immunoassays for the detection of binding anti-panitumumab antibodies: an acid dissociation bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting high-affinity antibodies and a Biacore ® biosensor immunoassay detecting both high- and low-affinity antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in screening immunoassays, an in vitro biological assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies. Monotherapy : The incidence of treatment-emergent binding anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.5% (7/1295) as detected by ELISA and 5.3% (68/1295) as detected by the Biacore ® assay. The incidence of neutralizing anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.8% (11/1295). There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics or safety profiles in patients who developed antibodies to panitumumab. In combination with chemotherapy : The incidence of treatment-emergent binding anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.9% (12/1297) as detected by the ELISA and 0.7% (9/1296) as detected by the Biacore ® assay. The incidence of neutralizing anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.2% (2/1297). No evidence of an altered safety profile was found in patients who developed antibodies to panitumumab. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vectibix. Because these reactions are reported in a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Skin necrosis, angioedema, life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Immune system disorders: Infusion reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Eye disorders: Keratitis/ulcerative keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]']","---------------------------Vectibix is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist indicated for the treatment of wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):  In combination with FOLFOX for first-line treatment.

The safety of COTELLIC was evaluated in Trial 1, a randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled trial in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14)]. All patients received vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily on Days 128 and received either COTELLIC 60 mg once daily (n=247) or placebo (n=246) on Days 121 of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the COTELLIC plus vemurafenib arm, 66% percent of patients were exposed for greater than 6 months and 24% of patients were exposed for greater than 1 year. Patients with abnormal liver function tests, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), active central nervous system lesions, or evidence of retinal pathology were excluded from Trial 1. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in Trial 1 are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In Trial 1, 15% of patients receiving COTELLIC experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of COTELLIC. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were liver laboratory abnormalities defined as increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.4%), increased 7Reference ID: 4212951                                                                 gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) (1.6%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (1.6%); rash (1.6%); pyrexia (1.2%); and retinal detachment (2%). Among the 247 patients receiving COTELLIC, adverse reactions led to dose interruption or reductions in 55%. The most common reasons for dose interruptions or reductions of COTELLIC were rash (11%), diarrhea (9%), chorioretinopathy (7%), pyrexia (6%), vomiting (6%), nausea (5%), and increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (4.9%). The most common (20%) adverse reactions with COTELLIC were diarrhea, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.  Table 3.

Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety of ALECENSA was evaluated in 152 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in the ALEX study. The median duration of exposure to ALECENSA was 17.9 months. Patient characteristics of the ALEX study population (n=303) were: median age 56 years, age less than 65 (77%), female (56%), Caucasian (50%), Asian (46%), adenocarcinoma histology (92%), never smoker (63%), and ECOG PS 0 or 1 (93%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients treated with ALECENSA; serious adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of patients treated with ALECENSA were pneumonia (4.6%), and renal impairment (3.9%). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported for 41% of patients in the ALECENSA arm. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with ALECENSA; these were renal impairment (2 patients), sudden death, cardiac arrest, and pneumonia (1 patient each). Permanent discontinuation of ALECENSA for adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients. Adverse drug reactions that led to discontinuation of ALECENSA in 1% or more of patients were renal impairment (2.0%), hyperbilirubinemia (1.3%), increased ALT (1.3%), and increased AST (1.3%). Dose reductions and drug interruption due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% and 19% of patients, respectively, in the ALECENSA arm.

Data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below reflects exposure to VITRAKVI in 176 patients, including 70 (40%) patients exposed for greater than 6 months and 35 (20%) patients exposed for greater than 1 year. VITRAKVI was studied in one adult dose-finding trial [LOXO-TRK-14001 (n = 70)], one pediatric dose-finding trial [SCOUT (n = 43)], and one single arm trial [NAVIGATE (n = 63)]. All patients had an unresectable or metastatic solid tumor and no satisfactory alternative treatment options or disease progression following treatment. Across these 176 patients, the median age was 51 years (range: 28 days to 82 years); 25% were 18 years or younger; 52% were male; and 72% were White, 11% were Hispanic/Latino, 8% were Black, and 3% were Asian. The most common tumors in order of decreasing frequency were soft tissue sarcoma (16%), salivary gland (11%), lung (10%), thyroid (9%), colon (8%), infantile fibrosarcoma (8%), primary central nervous system (CNS) (7%), or melanoma (5%). NTRK gene fusions were present in 60% of VITRAKVI-treated patients. Most adults (80%) received VITRAKVI 100 mg orally twice daily and 68% of pediatrics (18 years or younger) received VITRAKVI 100 mg/m2 twice daily up to a maximum dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dose ranged from 50 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily in adults and 9.6 mg/m2 twice daily to 120 mg/m2 twice daily in pediatrics [see Pediatric Use (8.4)].

The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to XALKORI in 1719 patients with NSCLC who received XALKORI 250 mg twice daily enrolled on Studies 1 (including an additional 109 patients who crossed over from the control arm), 2, 3, a single-arm trial (n=1063) of ALK-positive NSCLC, and an additional ALK-positive NSCLC expansion cohort of a dose finding study (n=154). The data also reflect exposure to XALKORI in 121 patients ages 1 to ≤21 years with relapsed or refractory tumors, including 26 patients with systemic ALCL, in a single-arm trial (Study ADVL0912). ALK- or ROS1-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The data described below is based primarily on 343 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily from 2 open-label, randomized, active-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2). The safety of XALKORI was also evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC from a single-arm study (Study 3). The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) of XALKORI in patients with NSCLC are vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, edema, constipation, elevated transaminases, fatigue, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, dizziness, and neuropathy. Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1 (PROFILE 1014) The data in Table 7 are derived from 340 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease who received treatment in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 1). Patients in the XALKORI arm (n=171) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 169 patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 (n=91) or carboplatin at a dose calculated to produce an AUC of 5 or 6 mg×min/mL (n=78). Chemotherapy was given by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, in the absence of dose-limiting chemotherapy-related toxicities. After 6 cycles, patients remained on study with no additional anticancer treatment, and tumor assessments continued until documented disease progression. The median duration of study treatment was 10.9 months for patients in the XALKORI arm and 4.1 months for patients in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of treatment was 5.2 months for patients who received XALKORI after cross over from chemotherapy. Across the 340 patients who were treated in Study 1, the median age was 53 years; 16% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 62% of patients were female and 46% were Asian. Serious adverse events were reported in 34% of patients treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse events reported in patients treated with XALKORI were dyspnea (4.1%) and pulmonary embolism (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 2.3% patients, consisting of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 6% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in these patients were nausea (1.8%) and elevated transaminases (1.8%). Permanent discontinuation of XALKORI treatment for adverse reactions was 8%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in XALKORI-treated patients were elevated transaminases (1.2%), hepatotoxicity (1.2%), and ILD (1.2%). Tables 7 and 8 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in XALKORI-treated patients. Table 7.

Patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed unless they had received pemetrexed as part of first-line or maintenance treatment. The median duration of study treatment was 7.1 months for patients who received XALKORI and 2.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy. Across the 347 patients who were randomized to study treatment (343 received at least 1 dose of study treatment), the median age was 50 years; 14% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 56% of patients were female and 45% of patients were Asian. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 37% of patients treated with XALKORI and 23% of patients in the chemotherapy arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with XALKORI were pneumonia (4.1%), pulmonary embolism (3.5%), dyspnea (2.3%), and ILD (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated patients in Study 2 occurred in 5% of patients, consisting of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, dyspnea, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, ILD, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 16% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with XALKORI were increased ALT (8%) including some patients with concurrent increased AST, QTc prolongation (2.9%), and neutropenia (2.3%). XALKORI was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of XALKORI were ILD (1.7%), increased ALT and AST (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), and pulmonary embolism (1.2%).

Vision disorders occurred in 92% of patients in Study 3; 90% were Grade 1 and 2% were Grade 2. The median duration of exposure to XALKORI was 34.4 months. Description of Selected Adverse Reactions in Patients with Metastatic NSCLC Vision disorders: Vision disorders, most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred vision, or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. There were 0.8% of patients with Grade 3 and 0.2% of patients with Grade 4 visual impairment. Based on the Visual Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ-ALK), patients treated with XALKORI in Studies 1 and 2 reported a higher incidence of visual disturbances compared to patients treated with chemotherapy. The onset of vision disorder generally was within the first week of drug administration. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4–7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact (scores 0 to 3 out of a maximum score of 10) on daily activities as captured in the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire. Neuropathy: Neuropathy, most commonly sensory in nature, occurred in 25% of 1719 patients. Most events (95%) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. Renal cysts: Renal cysts were experienced by 3.0% of 1719 patients. The majority of renal cysts in XALKORI-treated patients were complex. Local cystic invasion beyond the kidney occurred, in some cases with imaging characteristics suggestive of abscess formation. However, across clinical trials no renal abscesses were confirmed by microbiology tests. Renal toxicity: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from a baseline median of 96.42 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (n=1681) to a median of 80.23 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at 2 weeks (n=1499) in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who received XALKORI in clinical trials. No clinically relevant changes occurred in median eGFR from 12 to 104 weeks of treatment. Median eGFR slightly increased (83.02 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) 4 weeks after the last dose of XALKORI. Overall, 76% of patients had a decrease in eGFR to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 38% had a decrease to eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and 3.6% had a decrease to eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Relapsed or Refractory, Systemic ALK-Positive ALCL - Study ADVL0912 The safety of XALKORI was evaluated in Study ADVL0912 [see Clinical Studies 14.2 ] , which included 26 patients with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALCL after at least one systemic therapy. Eligible patients were 1 to ≤21 years of age and were required to have an absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm 3 (750/mm 3 if bone marrow was involved), platelet count ≥75,000/mm 3 (25,000/mm 3 if bone marrow was involved), creatinine clearance ≥70ml/min/1.73m 2 , and QTc ≤480 msec. The study excluded patients with ALT >2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN, and central nervous system tumors. Patients with ALCL received XALKORI 165 mg/m 2 or 280 mg/m 2 orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 1.8, 82.3 months), with 46% of patients treated for at least 6 months and 35% of patients treated for at least 12 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were neutropenia (12%) and hypotension (8%). Dose interruptions and dose reductions occurred in 77% and 19% of patients, respectively. XALKORI was discontinued for an adverse reaction in 8% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥35%), excluding laboratory abnormalities, were diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, vision disorder, headache, musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, fatigue, decreased appetite, pyrexia, abdominal pain, cough, and pruritis. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥15%) included neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥15%) included neutropenia (62%), lymphopenia (35%), and thrombocytopenia (19%). Selected adverse reactions are summarized in Table 11. Table 11.

Patients in the XALKORI arm (n=172) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 171 patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (n=99) or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (n=72) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed unless they had received pemetrexed as part of first-line or maintenance treatment. The median duration of study treatment was 7.1 months for patients who received XALKORI and 2.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy. Across the 347 patients who were randomized to study treatment (343 received at least 1 dose of study treatment), the median age was 50 years; 14% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 56% of patients were female and 45% of patients were Asian. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 37% of patients treated with XALKORI and 23% of patients in the chemotherapy arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with XALKORI were pneumonia (4.1%), pulmonary embolism (3.5%), dyspnea (2.3%), and ILD (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated patients in Study 2 occurred in 5% of patients, consisting of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, dyspnea, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, ILD, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 16% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with XALKORI were increased ALT (8%) including some patients with concurrent increased AST, QTc prolongation (2.9%), and neutropenia (2.3%). XALKORI was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of XALKORI were ILD (1.7%), increased ALT and AST (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), and pulmonary embolism (1.2%).

ROS1-Positive Metastatic NSCLC -Study 3 (PROFILE 1001) The safety profile of XALKORI from Study 3, which was evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC, was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC (n=1669). Vision disorders occurred in 92% of patients in Study 3; 90% were Grade 1 and 2% were Grade 2. The median duration of exposure to XALKORI was 34.4 months. Description of Selected Adverse Reactions in Patients with Metastatic NSCLC Vision disorders: Vision disorders, most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred vision, or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. There were 0.8% of patients with Grade 3 and 0.2% of patients with Grade 4 visual impairment. Based on the Visual Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ-ALK), patients treated with XALKORI in Studies 1 and 2 reported a higher incidence of visual disturbances compared to patients treated with chemotherapy. The onset of vision disorder generally was within the first week of drug administration. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4-7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact (scores 0 to 3 out of a maximum score of 10) on daily activities as captured in the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire. Neuropathy: Neuropathy, most commonly sensory in nature, occurred in 25% of 1719 patients. Most events (95%) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. Renal cysts: Renal cysts were experienced by 3.0% of 1719 patients. The majority of renal cysts in XALKORI-treated patients were complex. Local cystic invasion beyond the kidney occurred, in some cases with imaging characteristics suggestive of abscess formation. However, across clinical trials no renal abscesses were confirmed by microbiology tests. Renal toxicity: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from a baseline median of 96.42 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=1681) to a median of 80.23 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 2 weeks (n=1499) in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who received XALKORI in clinical trials. No clinically relevant changes occurred in median eGFR from 12 to 104 weeks of treatment. Median eGFR slightly increased (83.02 mL/min/1.73 m2) 4 weeks after the last dose of XALKORI. Overall, 76% of patients had a decrease in Reference ID: 4730020                                                                                                                                   eGFR to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 38% had a decrease to eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 3.6% had a decrease to eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Relapsed or Refractory, Systemic ALK-Positive ALCL -Study ADVL0912 The safety of XALKORI was evaluated in Study ADVL0912 [see Clinical Studies 14.2], which included 26 patients with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALCL after at least one systemic therapy. Eligible patients were 1 3 (750/mm3 if 3 (25,000/mm3 if bone marrow was involved), creatinine 2with ALT >2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), Patients with ALCL received XALKORI 165 mg/m2 or 280 mg/m2 orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 1.8, 82.3 months), with 46% of patients treated for at least 6 months and 35% of patients treated for at least 12 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were neutropenia (12%) and hypotension (8%). Dose interruptions and dose reductions occurred in 77% and 19% of patients, respectively. XALKORI was discontinued for an adverse reaction in 8% of patients. excluding laboratory abnormalities, were diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, vision disorder, headache, musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, fatigue, decreased appetite, pyrexia, abdominal pain, cough, and pruritis.

The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2–5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15.0%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3.0%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In Study 2, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3–5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2–5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1–5 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or Herceptin treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2–5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. Safety data from Study 4 reflect exposure to Herceptin as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and every three week dosing in the monotherapy period. Among these patients, the median age was 49 years (range 22 to 74 years). In Study 4, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in Studies 1, 2, and 3 with the exception of a low incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The data below reflect exposure to Herceptin in one randomized, open-label study, Study 5, of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and one single-arm study (Study 6; n = 222) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Data in Table 4 are based on Studies 5 and 6. Among the 464 patients treated in Study 5, the median age was 52 years (range: 25–77 years). Eighty-nine percent were White, 5% Black, 1% Asian, and 5% other racial/ethnic groups. All patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. The percentages of patients who received Herceptin treatment for ≥ 6 months and ≥ 12 months were 58% and 9%, respectively. Among the 352 patients treated in single agent studies (213 patients from Study 6), the median age was 50 years (range 28–86 years), 86% were White, 3% were Black, 3% were Asian, and 8% in other racial/ethnic groups. Most of the patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. The percentages of patients who received Herceptin treatment for ≥ 6 months and ≥ 12 months were 31% and 16%, respectively.

In the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm, the initial dose of Herceptin 8 mg/kg was administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1-14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of Herceptin treatment was 21 weeks; median number of Herceptin infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In Study 3, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year Herceptin arm); and in Studies 1 and 2, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. In Studies 1 and 2, 6% of all randomized patients with post-AC LVEF evaluation were not permitted to initiate Herceptin following completion of AC chemotherapy due to cardiac dysfunction (LVEF < LLN or ≥ 16 point decline in LVEF from baseline to end of AC). Following initiation of Herceptin therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in Studies 1 and 2, and in patients receiving one-year Herceptin monotherapy compared to observation in Study 3 (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The per-patient incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis also showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. Table 6 For Studies 1, 2 and 3, events are counted from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. For Study 4, events are counted from the date of randomization. : Per-patient Incidence of New Onset Myocardial Dysfunction (by LVEF) Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 LVEF < 50% and Absolute Decrease from Baseline Absolute LVEF Decrease LVEF < 50% ≥ 10% decrease ≥ 16% decrease < 20% and ≥ 10% ≥ 20% Studies 1 & 2 Studies 1 and 2 regimens: doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC→T) or paclitaxel plus Herceptin (AC→TH). , Median duration of follow-up for Studies 1 and 2 combined was 8.3 years in the AC→TH arm.

Figure 3 Study 4: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of ≥10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event Time 0 is the date of randomization. The incidence of treatment emergent congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I–IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received Herceptin concurrently with anthracyclines. In Study 7, 5.0% of patients in the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with Herceptin, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of Herceptin infusion); permanent discontinuation of Herceptin for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent Herceptin infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [Study 5]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2–5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [Study 1]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [Study 2]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of Herceptin as a single agent (Study 6), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer), on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4–5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [Study 2]) and of selected Grade 2–5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [Study 1]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [Study 5]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2–5 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [Study 1]) and of selected Grade 3–5 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4% [Study 2]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In Study 4, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of Herceptin to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3-4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2–5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [Study 1]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3–5 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [Study 2]) was higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2–5: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [Study 1]; NCI-CTC Grade 2–5: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [Study 2]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving Herceptin compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving Herceptin, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In Study 3, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year Herceptin treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving Herceptin for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) . Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [Study 1], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [Study 4] and 2.1% vs. 0% [Study 5]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2–5 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [Study 1]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3–5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [Study 2]), and of Grade 1–4 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [Study 3; one-year Herceptin treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin as compared to controls. In Study 4, the incidence of Grade 3–4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1–4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving Herceptin. Of patients receiving Herceptin as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the Herceptin-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the Herceptin-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of Herceptin therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to Herceptin was detected in one patient using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Herceptin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Herceptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with Herceptin. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated.

Adverse reactions Reference ID: 4356542 8                                                                                   requiring interruption or discontinuation of Herceptin treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions ( 10%) that were increased ( 5% difference) in the Herceptin arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia.  The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the Herceptincontaining arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adjuvant Breast Cancer Studies The data below reflect exposure to one-year Herceptin therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, Studies 1, 2, and 3, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. The data summarized in Table 3 below, from Study 3, reflect exposure to Herceptin in 1678 patients; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18.  Among the 3386 patients enrolled in the observation and one-year Herceptin arms of Study 3 at a median duration of follow-up of 12.6 months in the Herceptin arm, the median age was 49 years (range: 21 to 80 years), 83% of patients were Caucasian, and 13% were Asian.

In Study 3, a comparison of 3-weekly Herceptin treatment for two years versus one year was also performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year Herceptin treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6% in the one-year Herceptin treatment arm).  More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year Herceptin treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year Herceptin treatment arm (16.3%). The safety data from Studies 1 and 2 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received Herceptin; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks.  The median age was 49 years (range: 2480); 84% of patients were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 3% Asian. In Study 1, only Grade 35 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 25 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment.  The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 25 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone:  fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15.0%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3.0%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%).  The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In Study 2, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 35 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 25 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 15 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or Herceptin treatment.  The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 25 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. Safety data from Study 4 reflect exposure to Herceptin as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n 1056].  Reference ID: 4356542 11                                                                                                                                                                                                              The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and every three week dosing in the monotherapy period.  Among these patients, the median age was 49 years (range 22 to 74 years).  In Study 4, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in Studies 1, 2, and 3 with the exception of a low incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The data below reflect exposure to Herceptin in one randomized, open-label study, Study 5, of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and one single-arm study (Study 6; n = 222) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  Data in Table 4 are based on Studies 5 and 6. Among the 464 patients treated in Study 5, the median age was 52 years (range: 2577 years). Eighty-nine percent were White, 5% Black, 1% Asian, and 5% other racial/ethnic groups.  All patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed by 2 mg/kg weekly.  The percentages of patients who received Herceptin treatment for  6 months and  12 months were 58% and 9%, respectively. Among the 352 patients treated in single agent studies (213 patients from Study 6), the median age was 50 years (range 2886 years), 86% were White, 3% were Black, 3% were Asian, and 8% in other racial/ethnic groups.  Most of the patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed by 2 mg/kg weekly.  The percentages of patients who received Herceptin treatment for  6 months and  12 months were 31% and 16%, respectively.

In the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm, the initial dose of Herceptin 8 mg/kg was administered on Day 1 (prior to Reference ID: 4356542 13                                                                                                                                                       chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression.  Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice a day on Days 1Œ14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5.  Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of Herceptin treatment was 21 weeks; median number of Herceptin infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In Study 3, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year Herceptin arm); and in Studies 1 and 2, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. In Studies 1 and 2, 6% of all randomized patients with post-AC LVEF evaluation were not permitted to initiate Herceptin following completion of AC chemotherapy due to cardiac dysfunction (LVEF  LLN or  16 point decline in LVEF from baseline to end of AC).  Following initiation of Herceptin therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in Studies 1 and 2, and in patients receiving one-year Herceptin monotherapy compared to observation in Study 3 (see Table 6, Figures 1 and 2). The per-patient incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis also showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery.

In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received Herceptin concurrently with anthracyclines. In Study 7, 5.0% of patients in the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with Herceptin, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of Herceptin infusion); permanent discontinuation of Herceptin for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients.  Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia.  Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent Herceptin infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively.  In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [Study 5]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2Œ5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [Study 1]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [Study 2]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of Herceptin as a single agent (Study 6), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was  1%. In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer), on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCICTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 45 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [Study 2]) and of selected Grade 25 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [Study 1]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone.  In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [Study 5]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 25 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [Study 1]) and of selected Grade 35 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4% [Study 2]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone.  The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In Study 4, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of Herceptin to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)].  The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 34 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. Reference ID: 4356542 19                                                                                                                                                      In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 25 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [Study 1]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 35 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [Study 2]) was higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone.  The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 25: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [Study 1]; NCI-CTC Grade 25: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [Study 2]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving Herceptin compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.  Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving Herceptin, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In Study 3, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year Herceptin treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving Herceptin for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased.  Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions.  Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4). Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [Study 1], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [Study 4] and 2.1% vs. 0% [Study 5]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 25 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [Study 1]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 35 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [Study 2]), and of Grade 14 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [Study 3; one-year Herceptin treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin as compared to controls.  In Study 4, the incidence of Grade 34 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 14 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving Herceptin. Of patients receiving Herceptin as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea.  An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%.  Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the Herceptin-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the Herceptin-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported.  The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of Herceptin therapy.  Pathologic findings included membranous Reference ID: 4356542 20                                                                                                             glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis.  Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to Herceptin was detected in one patient using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  This patient did not experience an allergic reaction.  Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer. The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Herceptin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Herceptin.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with Herceptin. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated. "

Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC Without Prior ALK-targeted Therapy In ALTA 1L, the safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 136 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously received an ALK-targeted therapy [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The median duration of treatment with ALUNBRIG when administered as 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increased to 180 mg orally once daily, was 24.3 months. A total of 106 (78%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months including 92 (68%) patients exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The median relative dose intensity was 97% for ALUNBRIG. The study population (N = 275) characteristics were: median age 59 years (range: 27 to 89), age less than 65 years (68%), female (55%), White (59%), Asian (39%), Stage IV disease (93%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never smoker (58%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (95%), and CNS metastases at baseline (30%) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.4%), ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%), pyrexia (2.9%), dyspnea (2.2%), pulmonary embolism (2.2%), and asthenia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.9% of patients and included pneumonia (1.5%), cerebrovascular accident (0.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (0.7%). In ALTA 1L, 13% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%) and pneumonia (2.2%). In ALTA 1L, 38% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase (15%), increased lipase (6.6%), increased amylase (4.4%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.2%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.2%) and hypertension (2.2%).

Patients received ALUNBRIG 90 mg once daily continuously (90 mg group) or 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily (90→180 mg group). The median duration of treatment was 7.5 months in the 90 mg group and 7.8 months in the 90→180 mg group. A total of 150 (68%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months and 42 (19%) patients were exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The study population (N=222) characteristics were: median age 54 years (range: 18 to 82), age less than 65 years (77%), female (57%), White (67%), Asian (31%), Stage IV disease (98%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (97%), never or former smoker (95%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (93%), and CNS metastases at baseline (69%) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (5.5% overall, 3.7% in the 90 mg group, and 7.3% in the 90→180 mg group) and ILD/pneumonitis (4.6% overall, 1.8% in the 90 mg group and 7.3% in the 90→180 mg group). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients and consisted of pneumonia (2 patients), sudden death, dyspnea, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, bacterial meningitis and urosepsis (1 patient each). In ALTA, 2.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 8.2% of patients in the 90→180 mg group permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (0.9% in the 90 mg group and 1.8% in the 90→180 mg group) and pneumonia (1.8% in the 90→180 mg group only). In ALTA, 14% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions (7.3% in the 90 mg group and 20% in the 90→180 mg group).

Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC Without Prior ALK-targeted Therapy In ALTA 1L, the safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 136 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously received an ALK-targeted therapy [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The median duration of treatment with ALUNBRIG when administered as 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increased to 180 mg orally once daily, was 24.3 months. A total of 106 (78%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months including 92 (68%) patients exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The median relative dose intensity was 97% for ALUNBRIG. The study population (N = 275) characteristics were: median age 59 years (range: 27 to 89), age less than 65 years (68%), female (55%), White (59%), Asian (39%), Stage IV disease (93%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never smoker (58%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (95%), and CNS metastases at baseline (30%) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.4%), ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%), pyrexia (2.9%), dyspnea (2.2%), pulmonary embolism (2.2%), and asthenia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.9% of patients and included pneumonia (1.5%), cerebrovascular accident (0.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (0.7%).   Reference ID: 4612836   Page 10 of 30 In ALTA 1L, 13% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse  reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%) and pneumonia (2.2%). In ALTA 1L, 38% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase (15%), increased lipase (6.6%), increased amylase (4.4%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.2%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.2%) and hypertension (2.2%).

Epithelioid Sarcoma The safety of TAZVERIK was evaluated in a cohort (Cohort 5) of Study EZH-202 that enrolled patients with epithelioid sarcoma [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily (n=62). Among patients who received TAZVERIK, 44% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 24% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients who received TAZVERIK. Serious adverse reactions in % of patients who received TAZVERIK were hemorrhage, pleural effusion, skin infection, dyspnea, pain, and respiratory distress. One patient (2%) permanently discontinued TAZVERIK due to an adverse reaction of altered mood. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients who received TAZVERIK. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruptions were hemorrhage, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Dose reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in one (2%) patient who received TAZVERIK; the dose was reduced in this patient for decreased appetite. 20%) were pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipation.

The safety of PEMAZYRE was evaluated in FIGHT-202, which included 146 patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Patients were treated orally with PEMAZYRE 13.5 mg once daily for 14 days on followed by 7 days off therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 181 days (range: 7 to 730 days). The median age of PEMAZYRE treated patients was 59 years (range 26-78), 58% were females, and 71% were White. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving PEMAZYRE. Serious adverse reactions in ≥ 2% of patients who received PEMAZYRE included abdominal pain, pyrexia, cholangitis, pleural effusion, acute kidney injury, cholangitis infective, failure to thrive, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, small intestinal obstruction, and urinary tract infection. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.1% of patients, including failure to thrive, bile duct obstruction, cholangitis, sepsis, and pleural effusion. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients who received PEMAZYRE. Adverse reactions requiring permanent discontinuation in ≥1% of patients included intestinal obstruction and acute kidney injury. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients who received PEMAZYRE. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in ≥ 1% of patients included stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, arthralgia, fatigue, abdominal pain, AST increased, asthenia, pyrexia, ALT increased, cholangitis, small intestinal obstruction, alkaline phosphatase increased, diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, decreased appetite, dehydration, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypophosphatemia, back pain, pain in extremity, syncope, acute kidney injury, onychomadesis, and hypotension. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients who received PEMAZYRE. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in ≥1% of patients who received PEMAZYRE included stomatitis, arthralgia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, asthenia, and onychomadesis.
